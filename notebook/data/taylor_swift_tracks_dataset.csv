Fortnight (feat. Post Malone),THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY,6dODwocEuGzHAavXqTbwHv,228965,"[Lời bài hát ""Fortnight"" bởi Taylor Swift (feat. Post Malone)]




[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]


Em đáng ra phải bị bắt đi rồi


Nhưng người ta đã quên đến đón em


Em là một con sâu rượu đang sống ổn thoả


Cho đến khi chẳng còn ai để ý đến gu thẩm mỹ mới của em nữa


Tất cả để nói rằng


Em mong anh vẫn ổn


Nhưng anh chính là lý do


Và chẳng ai trách gì đâu


Nhưng còn sự phản bội lặng thầm của anh thì sao?




[Điệp Khúc: Taylor Swift]


Và trong suốt 2 tuần ấy, mình bên nhau muôn đời


Đôi lần chạm mặt anh, hỏi vu vơ thời tiết


Giờ anh sau sân vườn, hóa thành hàng xóm tốt


Vợ anh đang tưới hoa, em muốn giết chết ả




[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, 
Taylor Swift & Post Malone
, 
Post Malone
]


Những sớm mai của em là những thứ Hai mắc kẹt trong một 
tháng 2 bất tận


Em đã uống thứ thuốc bước tiếp diệu kỳ, nhưng 
tác dụng chỉ là tạm thời thôi


Và em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em


Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em


Em chạm vào anh trong vỏn vẹn 2 tuần


Em chạm vào anh
, nhưng em đã bên anh[Điệp Khúc: Taylor Swift, 
Taylor Swift & Post Malone
]


Và trong suốt 2 tuần ấy, 
mình đã cùng bên nhau


Đôi lần chạm mặt anh, hỏi 
vu vơ thời tiết


Giờ anh sau sân vườn, hóa 
thành hàng xóm tốt


Vợ anh đang tưới hoa, em muốn giết chết ả


Và trong suốt 2 tuần ấy, 
mình đã cùng bên nhau


Đôi lần chạm mặt anh, khen chiếc áo em mang


Giờ anh ở hòm thư, hóa thành hàng xóm tốt


Chồng em đang ngoại tình, em muốn giết chết ảnh

Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em

You left your typewriter at my apartment


Straight from the tortured poets department


I think some things I never say


Like, ""Who uses typewriters anyway?""


But you're in self-sabotage mode


Throwing spikes down on the road


But I've seen this episode
 
and still loved the show


Who else decodes you?




[Chorus]


And who's gonna hold you like me?


And who's gonna know you, if not me?


I laughed in your face and said


""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith


This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots""


And who's gonna hold you like me?

Nobody


No-fucking-body

[Verse 2]


You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate


We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist


I scratch your head, you fall asleep


Like a tattooed golden retriever


But you awaken with dread


Pounding nails in your head


But I've read this one where you come undone


I chose this cyclone with you[Chorus]


And who's gonna hold you like me?


(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)


And who's gonna know you like me?

[Bridge]


Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me


But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave


And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen


Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be


'Cause we're crazy


So tell me, who else is gonna know me?


At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger


And put it on the one people put wedding rings on


And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding[Chorus]


Who's gonna hold you? (Who?)

Just to leave me here, naked and alone

I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist


I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift


Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away


My spine split from carrying us up the hill


Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill


I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe

Thinkin', ""How much sad did you think I had


Did you think I had in me?""


Oh, the tragedy


So long, London

I didn't opt in to be your odd man out


I founded the club she's heard great things about

I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use


The spirit was gonе, we would never come to


And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free[Chorus]


For so long, London


Stitches undone


Two graves, one gun


I'll find someone

And you say I abandoned the ship


But I was going down with it


My white-knuckle dying grip


Holding tight to your quiet resentment


And my friends said it isn't right to be scared


Every day of a love affair


Every breath feels like rarest air


When you're not sure if he wants to be there




[Chorus]


So how much sad did you think I had


Did you think I had in me?


How much tragedy?


Just how low did you


Think I'd go 'fore I'd self-implode?


'Fore I'd have to go be free?

You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?

I forget if this was ever fun

Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, ""What a mess""


I just learned these people try and save you

Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'

It's mine alone to disgrace


I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing

God save the most judgmental creeps


Who say they want what's best for me


Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see


Thinkin' it can change the beat


Of my heart when he touches me


And counteract the chemistry


And undo the destiny

Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice

Bestow upon my fakest smiles


Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer

Went to my parents and they came around

Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and


Even my daddy just loves him


I'm his lady

Time, doesn't it give some perspective?


And, no, you can't come to the wedding

Guilty as Sin?,THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY,799KrpEbhZp0MHeiA8YK9P,254365,"[Verse 1]


Drownin' in the Blue Nile


He sent me ""Downtown Lights""


I hadn't heard it in a while


My boredom's bone-deep


This cage was once just fine


Am I allowed to cry?


I dream of crackin' locks


Throwin' my life to the wolves
 or 
the ocean rocks


Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox


I'm seeing visions


Am I bad or mad or wise?




[Chorus]


What if he's written 
""mine""
 on my 
upper thigh
 
only in my mind?


One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze


Oh, what a way to die


I keep recalling things we never did


Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts


Without ever touchin' his skin


How can I be guilty as sin?




[Verse 2]


I keep these longings lockеd


In lowercase, inside a vault


Somеone told me, ""There's no such thing as bad thoughts


Only your actions talk""


These fatal fantasies


Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me


We've already done it in my head


If it's make-believe


Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?[Chorus]


What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?


One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze


Oh, what a way to die


My bed sheets are ablaze


I've screamed his name


Buildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave


Without ever touchin' his skin


How can I be guilty as sin?




[Bridge]


What if I roll the stone away?


They're gonna crucify me anyway


What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?


If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me


They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly


I choose you and me religiously




[Chorus]


What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?


One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze


Oh, what a way to die


I keep recalling things we never did


Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts


Without ever touchin' his skin


How can I be guilty as sin?[Outro]

So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs


I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?


That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn


That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong


Put narcotics into all of my songs


And that's why you're still singin' along

But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger

The dopamine races through his brain


On a six-lane Texas highway


His hand so calloused from his pistol


Softly traces hearts on my face

He just hadn't met me yеt

Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames


If we know the steps anyway?


We embroidered the memories of the time I was away


Stitching, ""We were just kids, babe""


I said, ""I don't mind, it takes time""


I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed


I felt aglow like this


Never before and never since

If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary


You and I go from one kiss to getting married


Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery


Never quite buried


In your suit and tie,

You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life


You said I'm the love of your life


About a million times

Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate


And told me I reformed you?


When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes


Well, you took me to hell too


And all at once, the ink bleeds


A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme


But I've felt a hole like this


Never before and ever since[Chorus]

Still alive, killing time at the cemetery

Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles


I wish I could un-recall


How we almost had it all


Dancing phantoms on the terrace


Are they second-hand embarrassed


That I can't get out of bed


'Cause something counterfeit's dead?


It was legendary


It was momentary


It was unnecessary


Should've let it stay buried

Oh, what a valiant roar


What a bland goodbye


The coward claimed he was a lion


I'm combing through the braids of lies

Locked me up in towers

I'll tell you how I've been there too


And that none of it matters

And they believed it


Jackals raised their hackles


You couldn't conceive it


You were sleeping soundly


When they dragged you from your bed


And I tried to warn you about them

So I crossed my thoughtless heart


Spread my wings like a parachute


I'm the albatross


I swept in at the rescue


The devil that you know


Looks now more like an angel


I'm the life you chose


And all this terrible danger

Your hologram stumbled into my apartment


Hands in the hair of somebody in darkness


Named Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus


And I just watched it happen


As the decade would play us for fools


And you saw my bones out with somebody new


Who seemed like he would've bullied you in school


And you just watched it happen

If you wanna break my cold, cold heart


Just say, ""I loved you the way that you were""


If you wanna tear my world apart


Just say you've always wondered




[Verse 2]


You said some things that I can't unabsorb


You turned me into an idea of sorts


You needed me, but you needed drugs more


And I couldn't watch it happen


I changed into goddesses, villains, and fools


Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules


All to outrun my desertion of you


And you just watched it[Chorus]


If you wanna break my cold, cold heart


Just say, ""I loved you the way that you were""


If you wanna tear my world apart


Just say you've always wondered




[Bridge]


If the glint in my eye traced the depths of your sigh


Down that passage in time back to the moment


I crashed into you, like so many wrecks do


Too impaired by my youth to know what to do




[Verse 3]


So if I sell my apartment


And you have some kids with an internet starlet


Will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon


Like it never happened?


Could it be enough to just float in your orbit?


Can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses?


Cooler in theory, but not if you force it to be


It just didn't happen

Say you loved me

Em mong anh vẫn ổn


Nhưng anh chính là lý do


Và chẳng ai trách gì đâu


Nhưng còn sự phản bội lặng thầm của anh thì sao?

Đám bạn em đều diện đồ ren che đi những tội ác




And your cheating husband disappeared, well


Và ông chồng ngoại tình của người đã biến mất




No one asks any questions here


Well, chẳng có ai thắc mắc gì ở chốn này




So I did my best to lay to rest


Nên em cứ thoải mái nghỉ ngơi




All of the bodies that have ever been on my body


Tất thảy những thân xác đã từng qua tay em




And in my mind, they sink into the swamp


Trong tâm trí em, họ đã chìm hết xuống đầm lầyIs that a bad thing to say in a song?


Đấy có phải một điều tệ hại để kể trong một bài hát không ta?




Little did you know your home's


Người liệu có biết rằng quê nhà của người




Really only the town you'll get arrested


Thật sự sẽ là nơi người bị bắt giữ




So you pack your life away


Nên người làm việc cật lực




Just to wait out the shitstorm


Chỉ để chờ cho cơn bão dư luận tan đi




Back in Texas


Ở Texas




Florida!!!


Florida!!!




Is one hell of a drug


Là một thứ ma dược




Florida!!!


Florida!!!




Can I use you up?


Em dùng hết được không?




I need to forget so


Em cần phải quên đi




Take me to Florida


Đưa em đến Florida




I got some regrets


Em có vài nuối tiếc




I'll bury them in Florida


Em sẽ chôn vùi chúng ở Florida




Tell me I'm despicable


Nói rằng em là kẻ đáng khinh




Say it's unforgivable


Bảo điều ấy là chẳng thể tha thứ




At least the dolls are beautiful


Ít nhất thì đám búp bê cũng xinh xắn đấy chứ




Fuck me up, Florida!


Phá hủy em đi, hỡi Florida




I need to forget so


Em cần phải quên đi




Take me to Florida


Đưa em đến Florida

Thật tan nát, thật vội vàng




Fuck me up, Florida!


Phá hủy em đi, hỡi Florida




It's one hell of a drug


Là một thứ ma dược




It's one hell of a drug


Là một thứ ma dược




Love left me like this


Tình yêu khiến em thành thế này




And I don't want to exist


Và em chẳng còn muốn tồn tại nữa




So take me to Florida


Hãy đưa em đến Florida




Little did you know


Người liệu có biết rằng




Your home's really only a town


Thành phố quê người chỉ là một chốn




You're just a guest in


Nơi người là khách




So you work your life away


Nên người làm việc cật lực




Just to pay for a timeshare


Chỉ để thuê một căn timeshare




Down in Destin


Ở tận Destin




Little did you know your home's


Người liệu có biết rằng quê nhà của người




Really only the town you'll get arrested

Guilty as Sin?,THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT,0W0iAC1VGlB82PI6elxFYf,254365,"[Verse 1]


Drownin' in the Blue Nile


He sent me ""Downtown Lights""


I hadn't heard it in a while


My boredom's bone-deep


This cage was once just fine


Am I allowed to cry?


I dream of crackin' locks


Throwin' my life to the wolves
 or 
the ocean rocks


Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox


I'm seeing visions


Am I bad or mad or wise?




[Chorus]


What if he's written 
""mine""
 on my 
upper thigh
 
only in my mind?


One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze


Oh, what a way to die


I keep recalling things we never did


Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts


Without ever touchin' his skin


How can I be guilty as sin?




[Verse 2]


I keep these longings lockеd


In lowercase, inside a vault


Somеone told me, ""There's no such thing as bad thoughts


Only your actions talk""


These fatal fantasies


Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me


We've already done it in my head


If it's make-believe


Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?[Chorus]


What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?


One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze


Oh, what a way to die


My bed sheets are ablaze


I've screamed his name


Buildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave


Without ever touchin' his skin


How can I be guilty as sin?




[Bridge]


What if I roll the stone away?


They're gonna crucify me anyway


What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?


If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me


They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly


I choose you and me religiously




[Chorus]


What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?


One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze


Oh, what a way to die


I keep recalling things we never did

How can I be guilty as sin?[Outro]

You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me


So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs


I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?


That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn


That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong


Put narcotics into all of my songs


And that's why you're still singin' along

Like a freight train through a small town


The jokes that he told across the bar


Were revolting and far too loud

But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger

On a six-lane Texas highway

Softly traces hearts on my face

Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames


If we know the steps anyway?


We embroidered the memories of the time I was away


Stitching, ""We were just kids, babe""


I said, ""I don't mind, it takes time""


I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed


I felt aglow like this


Never before and never since

Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery


Never quite buried

You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life


You said I'm the love of your life

Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate


And told me I reformed you?


When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes


Well, you took me to hell too


And all at once, the ink bleeds


A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme


But I've felt a hole like this


Never before and ever since[Chorus]

Still alive, killing time at the cemetery

Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles


I wish I could un-recall


How we almost had it all


Dancing phantoms on the terrace


Are they second-hand embarrassed


That I can't get out of bed


'Cause something counterfeit's dead?


It was legendary


It was momentary


It was unnecessary


Should've let it stay buried

Oh, what a valiant roar


What a bland goodbye


The coward claimed he was a lion


I'm combing through the braids of lies

You had people who called you on unmarked numbers


In my peripheral vision

All was quickly forgiven


You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious


Flush with the currency of cool


I was always turnin' out my empty pockets


And when it came to you

I didn't come here to make friends


We were born to be suburban legends


When you hold me, it holds me together


And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs


Would surprise the whole school


When I ended up back at our class reunion


Walkin' in with you


You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries


With the pages ripped out


I am standin' in a 1950s gymnasium


And I can still see you now[Chorus]


I didn't come here to make friends


We were born to be suburban legends


When you hold me, it holds me together


And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

We were born to be national treasures


When you told me we'd get back together


And you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

One look, dark room, meant just for you


Time moved too fast, you play it back


Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke


No proof, not much, but you saw enough


Small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight


The light reflects the chain on your neck


He says, ""Look up"" and your shoulders brush


No proof, one touch, but you felt enough




[Chorus]


You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you


You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you


You can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)


You are in love, true love, you are in lovе




[Verse 2]


Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday


You keep his shirt, he keeps his word


And for once, you lеt go of your fears and your ghosts


One step, not much, but it said enough


You kiss on sidewalks, you fight, then you talk


One night, he wakes, strange look on his face


Pauses, then says, ""You're my best friend""


And you knew what it was, he is in love[Chorus]


You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you


You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you

You are in love, true love, you are in love

And so it goes


You two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round


And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown


And you understand now


Why they lost their minds and fought the wars


And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

You can feel it on the way home

And I am hiding in the curtains


It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be[Pre-Chorus]

But I know you wish it was me


You wish it was me, don't you?

Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh

I hear the preacher say


""Speak now or forever hold your peace""


There's the silence, there's my last chance


I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me


Horrified looks from everyone in the room


But I'm only lookin' at you[Verse 3]


I am not the kind of girl


Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion


But you are not the kind of boy


Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha

So, don't say yes, run away now


I'll meet you when you're out


Of the church, at the back door


Don't wait or say a single vow


You need to hear me out

And you say, ""Let's run away now (Run away now)

Long were the nights


When my days once revolved around you


Counting my footsteps


Prayin' the floor won't fall through again


And my mother accused me of losin' my mind


But I swore I was fine


You paint me a blue sky


Then go back and turn it to rain


And I lived in your chess game


But you change the rules every day


Wonderin' which version of you


I might get on the phone tonight


Well, I stopped pickin' up


And this song is to let you know why




[Chorus]


Dear John,
 I see it all now that you're gone


Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?


The girl in the dress cried the whole way home


I shoulda known




[Verse 2]


Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame


Or maybe it's you and your sick need


To give love and take it away


And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors


Who don't understand


And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said


""Run as fast as you can""[Chorus]


Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone


Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?


The girl in the dress cried the whole way home


Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong


Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by


Your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?


I shoulda known

You are an expert at ""Sorry"" and keepin' lines blurry


Never impressed by me acing your tests


All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes


'Cause you burned them out


But I took your matches before fire could catch me


So don't look now


I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town

And it's so quiet in the world tonight


Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming

And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots[Pre-Chorus]


But don't make her drop you off around the block


Remember that she's gettin' older, too


And don't lose the way that you dance around


In your PJs getting ready for school

So, here I am in my new apartment


In a big city, they just dropped me off

Vanished when I saw your face

Starts to make its way to me

Like passing notes in secrecy

I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets


How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something


There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions[Pre-Chorus]

Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes

I never imagined we'd end like this


Your name, forever the name on my lips, mmm

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep


And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe


And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are


Hope it's nice where you are




[Verse 3]


And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day


And something reminds you you wish you had stayed


You can plan for a change in the weather and time


But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go


Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes


All that I know is I don't know


How to be somethin' you miss[Chorus]


I never thought we'd have a last kiss

I said, ""Remember this moment""


In the back of my mind


The time we stood with our shaking hands


The crowds in stands went wild


We were the kings and the queens


And they read off our names


The night you danced like you knew our lives


Would never be the same


You held your head like a hero


On a history book page


It was the end of a decade


But the start of an age




[Chorus]


Long live the walls we crashеd through


How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you


I was scrеaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""


And bring on all the pretenders


One day, we will be remembered




[Verse 2]


I said, ""Remember this feeling""


I pass the pictures around


Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines


Wishin' for right now


We are the kings and the queens


You traded your baseball cap for a crown


When they gave us our trophies


And we held them up for our town


And the cynics were outraged


Screaming, ""This is absurd""


'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves


In ripped up jeans got to rule the world[Chorus]


Long live the walls we crashed through


How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you


I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""


And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid


Long live all the mountains we moved


I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you


I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""


And bring on all the pretenders


One day, we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around


Confetti falls to the ground


May these memories break our fall


Will you take a moment? Promise me this


That you'll stand by me forever


But if, God forbid, fate should step in


And force us into a goodbye


If you have children some day


When they point to the pictures


Please, tell 'em my name


Tell 'em how the crowds went wild


Tell 'em how I hope they shine


Long live the walls we crashed through


I had the time of my life with you[Chorus]

Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs


If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves

And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do


The jury's out, but my choice is you

Só respire, só relaxe, vai ficar tudo bem


Apenas uma hora para que o seu carro esteja no estacionamento

Tenho um histórico de histórias terminando de maneira triste


Ainda torcendo para que o fogo não me queime

When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor


Closes the blinds and locks the door


When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom


Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong


She waits and takes her time


'Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain


When Emma falls in love, I know


That boy will never be the same




[Chorus]


'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down


Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town


And all the bad boys would be good boys


If they only had a chance to love her


And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her




[Verse 2]


When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face


Hangs in the air like stars in outer space


When Emma falls in love, she disappears


And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years


When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone


She takes on the pain and bears it on her own


'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps


She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave[Chorus]


And she's the kind of book that you can't put down


Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town


And all the bad boys would be good boys


If they only had a chance to love her


And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

Well, she's so New York when she's in L.A.​​


She won't lose herself in love the way that I did


'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place


When Emma falls in love, I'm learning

Emma met a boy with eyes like a man


Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand


Now he'll be her shelter when it rains


Little does he know, his whole world's about to change

We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf

""Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how""

Looked up at the sky and it was


The burgundy on my t-shirt


When you splashed your wine into me


And how the blood rushed into my cheeks


So scarlet, it was


The mark thеy saw on my collarbone


The rust that grew bеtween telephones


The lips I used to call home


So scarlet, it was maroon

When the silence came


We were shaking, blind and hazy


How the hell did we lose sight of us again?


Sobbing with your head in your hands


Ain't that the way shit always ends?


You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway


Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us


I feel you, no matter what


The rubies that I gave up[Chorus]

Midnights become my afternoons


When my depression works the graveyard shift

all of the people


I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices


They come with prices and vices


I end up in crisis

I wake up screaming from dreaming


One day, I'll watch as you're leaving


'Cause you got tired of my scheming


(For the last time)

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby


And I'm a monster on the hill

Like some kind of congressman?

One night, a few moons ago


I saw flecks of what could've been lights

And time can't stop me quite like you did


And my flight was awful, thanks for asking


I'm unglued, thanks to you

Full of cages, full of fences


Pageant queens and big pretenders


But for some, it was paradise


My boy was a montage


A slow-motion, love potion


Jumping off things in the ocean

He was sunshine, I was midnight rain

Picture perfect shiny family


Holiday peppermint candy


But for him, it's every day


So I peered through a window


A deep portal, time travel


All the love we unravel

Once upon a time, the planets and the fates


And all the stars aligned


You and I ended up in the same room


At the same time




[Pre-Chorus]


And the touch of a hand lit the fuse


Of a chain reaction of countermoves


To assess the equation of you


Checkmate, I couldn't lose




[Chorus]


What if I told you none of it was accidental?


And the first night that you saw me


Nothing was gonna stop me


I laid the groundwork, and then


Just like clockwork


The dominoes cascaded in a line


What if I told you I'm a mastermind?


And now you're mine


It was all by dеsign


'Cause I'm a mastermind




[Verse 2]


You see, all the wisеst women


Had to do it this way


'Cause we were born to be the pawn


In every lover's game[Pre-Chorus]


If you fail to plan, you plan to fail


Strategy sets the scene for the tale


I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails


And the liquor in our cocktails




[Chorus]


What if I told you none of it was accidental?


And the first night that you saw me


I knew I wanted your body

And now you're mine


It was all my design

No one wanted to play with me as a little kid


So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since


To make them love me and make it seem effortless


This is the first time I've felt the need to confess


And I swear


I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian


'Cause I care[Chorus]


So I told you none of it was accidental


And the first night that you saw me


Nothing was gonna stop me

Saw a wide smirk on your face


You knew the entire time


You knew that I'm a mastermind

My knuckles were bruised like violets


Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked


Spineless in my tomb of silence


Tore your banners down, took the battle underground


And maybe it was egos swinging


Maybe it was her


Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur




[Chorus]

Uh-huh, sweet dream was over


My hand was the one you reached for


All throughout the Great War

You drew up some good faith treaties


I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone


You said I have to trust more freely


But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire


And maybe it's the past that's talking


Screaming from the crypt


Telling me to punish you for things you never did


So I justified it[Chorus]


All that bloodshed, crimson clover


Uh-huh, the bombs were closer


My hand was the one you reached for


All throughout the Great War


Always remember


Uh-huh, the burning embers


I vowed not to fight anymore

It turned into something bigger


Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed


Your finger on my hairpin triggers


Soldier down on that icy ground


Looked up at me with honor and truth


Broken and blue, so I called off the troops


That was the night I nearly lost you


I really thought I'd lost you

We can plant a memory garden


Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair


There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair


And we will never go back[Chorus]

One night, a few moons ago


I saw flecks of what could've been lights


But it might just have been you


Passing by unbeknownst to me


Life is emotionally abusive


And time can't stop me quite like you did


And my flight was awful, thanks for asking


I'm unglued, thanks to you




[Chorus: Taylor Swift, 
Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey

And it's like snow at the beach


Weird, but fuckin' beautiful


Flying in a dream


Stars by the pocketful


You wanting me


Tonight feels impossible


But it's comin' down


No sound, it's all around

This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen


I searched ""aurora borealis green""


I've never seen someone lit from within


Blurring out my periphery


My smile is
 like I won a contest


And to hide that would be so dishonest


And it's fine
 to fake it 'til you make it


'Til you do, 'til it's true

Summer went away, still, the yearning stays


I play it cool with the best of them


I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me


It's okay, we're the best of friends


Anyway


I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys


I touch my phone as if it's your face


I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out


There's just one who could make me stay

He wanted a bride, I was making my own name


Chasing that fame, he stayed the same


All of me changed like midnight

My town was a wasteland


Full of cages, full of fences


Pageant queens and big pretenders


But for some, it was paradise


My boy was a montage


A slow-motion, love potion


Jumping off things in the ocean


I broke his heart 'cause he was nice


He was sunshine, I was midnight rain

He wanted a bride, I was making my own name


Chasing that fame, he stayed the same

Picture perfect shiny family


Holiday peppermint candy


But for him, it's every day


So I peered through a window


A deep portal, time travel


All the love we unravel


And the life I gave away

My knuckles were bruised like violets


Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked


Spineless in my tomb of silence


Tore your banners down, took the battle underground


And maybe it was egos swinging


Maybe it was her


Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur




[Chorus]


All that bloodshed, crimson clover


Uh-huh, sweet dream was over


My hand was the one you reached for


All throughout the Great War


Always remember


Uh-huh, tears on the lеtter


I vowed not to cry anymore


If wе survived the Great War




[Verse 2]


You drew up some good faith treaties


I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone


You said I have to trust more freely


But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire


And maybe it's the past that's talking


Screaming from the crypt


Telling me to punish you for things you never did


So I justified it[Chorus]


All that bloodshed, crimson clover


Uh-huh, the bombs were closer


My hand was the one you reached for


All throughout the Great War


Always remember


Uh-huh, the burning embers


I vowed not to fight anymore


If we survived the Great War




[Post-Chorus]


Uh-huh, uh-huh




[Bridge]


It turned into something bigger


Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed


Your finger on my hairpin triggers


Soldier down on that icy ground


Looked up at me with honor and truth


Broken and blue, so I called off the troops


That was the night I nearly lost you


I really thought I'd lost you




[Verse 3]


We can plant a memory garden


Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair


There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair


And we will never go back[Chorus]

My hand was the one you reached for

This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen


I searched ""aurora borealis green""


I've never seen someone lit from within


Blurring out my periphery


My smile is
 like I won a contest


And to hide that would be so dishonest


And it's fine
 to fake it 'til you make it


'Til you do, 'til it's true




[Chorus: 
Taylor Swift

Now, it's like
 snow at the beach


Weird, but fuckin' beautiful


Flying in a dream


Stars by the pocketful


You wanting me


Tonight feels impossible


But it's comin' down


No sound, it's all around

"You're On Your Own, Kid",Midnights,4D7BCuvgdJlYvlX5WlN54t,194206,"[Verse 1]


Summer went away, still, the yearning stays


I play it cool with the best of them


I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me


It's okay, we're the best of friends


Anyway


I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys


I touch my phone as if it's your face


I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out


There's just one who could make me stay


All my days




[Pre-Chorus]


From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes


I waited ages to see you there


I search the party of better bodies


Just to learn that you never cared

You're on your own, kid


You always have been

I see the great escape,
 
so long, Daisy May


I picked the petals, he loves me not


Something different bloomed, writing in my room


I play my songs in the parking lot


I'll run away[Pre-Chorus]

I called a taxi to take me there


I search the party of better bodies


Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare

You're on your own, kid


You always have been

[Bridge]


From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes


I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this


I hosted parties and starved my body


Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss


The jokes weren't funny
, 
I took the money


My friends from home don't know what to say


I looked around in a blood-soaked gown


And I saw something they can't take away


'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned


Everything you lose is a step you take


So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it


You've got no reason to be afraid[Chorus]

Rain


He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain


He wanted a bride, I was making my own name


Chasing that fame, he stayed the same


All of me changed like midnight




[Verse 1]


My town was a wasteland


Full of cages, full of fences


Pageant queens and big pretenders


But for some, it was paradise


My boy was a montage


A slow-motion, love potion


Jumping off things in the ocean


I broke his heart 'cause he was nice


He was sunshine, I was midnight rain

He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain


He wanted a bride, I was making my own name


Chasing that fame, he stayed the same


All of me changed like midnight




[Verse 2]


It came like a postcard


Picture perfect shiny family


Holiday peppermint candy


But for him, it's every day


So I peered through a window


A deep portal, time travel


All the love we unravel


And the life I gave away


'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain[Chorus]


He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain


He wanted a bride, I was making my own name


Chasing that fame, he stayed the same


All of me changed like midnight rain

He wanted a bride, I was making my own name


Chasing that fame, he stayed the same


All of me changed like midnight

I guess sometimes we all get


Just what we wanted, just what we wanted

I just may like some explanations

Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh


When she said it was too much?


Do you wish you could still touch her?

Half-moon eyes, bad surprise


Did you realize out of time?


She was on your mind with some dickhead guy


That you saw that night


But you were on somethin'


It was one drink after another


Fuckin' politics and gender roles

Got swept away in the gray

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street


Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly


Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall


Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all




[Chorus]


Losing him was blue like I'd never known


Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)


Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met


But loving him was red (Red, red)


(Red, red)


But loving him was red (Red, red)


(Red, red)




[Verse 2]


Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you


Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song


Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer


Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong




[Chorus]


Losing him was blue like I'd never known

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes


Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go


But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head


In burning red


Burning, it was red




[Chorus]


Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known


Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)


Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met


'Cause loving him was red (Red, red)


Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)


Oh, burning red (Red, red)

The Last Time (feat. Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol) (Taylor’s Version),Red (Taylor's Version),0y6kdSRCVQhSsHSpWvTUm7,299080,"Prologue
There's an old poem by Neruda that I've always been captivated by, and one of the lines in it has stuck with me ever since the first time I read it. It says ""love is so short, forgetting is so long.""
 It's a line I've related to in my saddest moments, when I needed to know someone else had felt that exact same way. And when we're trying to move on the moments we always go back to aren't the mundane ones. They are the moments you saw sparks that weren't really there, felt stars aligning without having any proof, 
saw your future before it happened,
 and then saw it slip away without any warning. These are moments of 
newfound hope,
 
extreme joy,
 
intense passion,
 wishful thinking, and in some cases, 
the unthinkable letdown.
 
And in my mind, every one of these memories looks the same to me. I see all of these moments in bright, burning 
red
.




My experiences in love have taught me difficult lessons, especially my experiences with crazy love. The 
red
 relationships. The ones that went from zero to a hundred miles per hour and then hit a wall and exploded. And it was awful. And ridiculous. And desperate. And thrilling.
 
And when the dust settled, it was something I’d never take back.
 
Because there is something to be said for being young and needing someone so badly, you jump in head first without looking.
 
And there's something to be learned from waiting all day for a train that's never coming.
 And there's something to be proud of about moving on and realizing that 
real love shines golden like starlight
, and doesn't fade or spontaneously combust. 
Maybe I’ll write a whole album about that kind of love if I ever find it. but this album is about the other kinds of love that I’ve recently fallen in and out of.
 
Love that was treacherous, sad, beautiful, and tragic.
 
But most of all, this record is about love that was 
red
.

Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme


Took off faster than a green light, go


Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know


I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made


And that was the first day




[Chorus]


And darlin', it was good


Never lookin' down


And right there where we stood


Was holy ground




[Verse 2]


Spinnin' like a girl in a brand new dress


We had this big, wide city all to ourselves


Wе block the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""


And for thе first time, I had something to lose


And I guess we fell apart in the usual way


And the story's got dust on every page


But, sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now


And I see your face in every crowd[Chorus]


'Cause, darlin', it was good (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)


Never lookin' down (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)


And right there where we stood (Ooh-ayy)


Was holy ground

Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah

Tonight, I'm gonna dance


For all that we've been through


But I don't wanna dance


If I'm not dancin' with you


Tonight, I'm gonna dance


Like you were in this room


But I don't wanna dance


If I'm not dancin' with you

New to town with a made-up name


In the angel's city, chasin' fortune and fame

Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool


So overnight, you look like a '60s queen

And now, it's big black cars and Riviera views


And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you


And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page


And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused


'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used


And all the young things line up to take your place[Pre-Chorus]

It was a few years later, I showed up here


And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared


How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out


They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere


Chose the rose garden over Madison Square


And it took some time, but I understand it now

As I comb back through my memory

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors


It's the mornin' of your very first day


You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while


Try and stay out of everybody's way


It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here


For the next four years in this town


Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say


""You know, I haven't seen you around before""




[Chorus]


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you


You're gonna believe them


And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out


Well, count to ten, take it in


This is life before you know who you're gonna be


At fifteen




[Verse 2]


You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail


And soon enough, you're best friends


Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool


We'll be outta here as soon as we can


And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car


And you're feelin' like flyin'


And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one


And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends


When the night ends[Chorus]


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you


You're gonna believe them


And when you're fifteen and your first kiss


Makes your head spin around, well


In your life you'll do things greater than


Datin' the boy on the football team


I didn't know it at fifteen




[Bridge]


When all you wanted was to be wanted


Wish you could go back


And tell yourself what you know now




[Verse 3]


Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday


But I realized some bigger dreams of mine


And Abigail gave everything she had


To a boy who changed his mind


And we both cried




[Chorus]


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you


You're gonna believe them


And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall


But I've found time can heal most anything


And you just might find who you're supposed to be


I didn't know who I was supposed to be

See you make your way through the crowd


And say, ""Hello""

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles


And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""


And I was crying on the staircase


Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone


I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run


You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

I keep waiting for you, but you never come


Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""


He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said


""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone

I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye


And we caught onto somethin'


I hold onto the night


You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me


Were you just kiddin'?


'Cause it seems to me


This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak


I don't feel welcome anymore


Baby, what happened? Please, tell me


'Cause, one second, it was perfect


Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called


And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all


And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always,"" oh


Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong


It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone


'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""




[Verse 2]


Was I out of line?


Did I say somethin' way too honest, made you run and hide


Like a scared little boy?


I looked into your eyes


Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure


So here's to everything coming down to nothin'


Here's to silence that cuts me to the core


Where is this going?


Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore[Chorus]


And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called

I'm five years old, it's gettin' cold, I've got my big coat on


I hear your laugh and look up smilin' at you, I run and run


Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides, look, now the sky is gold


I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home




[Chorus]


I don't know why all the trees change in the fall


But I know you're not scared of anything at all


Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away


But I know I had the best day with you today




[Verse 2]


I'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so mean


I come home cryin' and you hold me tight and grab the keys


And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away


And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names




[Chorus]


I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school


But I know I'm laughin' on the car ride home with you


Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay


But I know I had the best day with you today




[Bridge]


I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger


God smiles on my little brother, inside and out, he's better than I am


I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run


And I had the best days with you[Verse 3]


There is a video I found from back when I was three


You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talkin' to me


It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves


Daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world




[Chorus]


Now I know why all the trees change in the fall


I know you were on my side even when I was wrong


And I love you for givin' me your eyes


For staying back and watchin' me shine


And I didn't know if you knew


So I'm taking this chance to say


That I had the best day with you today",Calm,0.642,0.576,1,-8.524,1,0.0282,0.488,0.0,0.159,0.469,125.0,audio_features,6ON9UuIq49xXY9GPmHIYRp,spotify:track:6ON9UuIq49xXY9GPmHIYRp,https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/6ON9UuIq49xXY9GPmHIYRp,https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/6ON9UuIq49xXY9GPmHIYRp,245290,4

Fight for what we've worked for all these years

The more that you say, the less I know


Wherever you stray, I follow


I'm begging for you to take my hand


Wreck my plans, that's my man


You know that my train could take you home


Anywhere else is hollow


I'm begging for you to take my hand


Wreck my plans, that's my man[Bridge]


Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind


They count me out time and time again


Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind


But I come back stronger than a '90s trend




[Verse 3]


Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark


Show me the places where the others gave you scars


Now this is an open-shut case


I guess I should've known from the look on your face


Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

You booked the night train for a reason


So you could sit there in this hurt


Bustling crowds or silent sleepers


You're not sure which is worse

You told your family for a reason


You couldn't keep it in


Your sister splashed out on the bottle


Now no one's celebrating

Love slipped beyond your reaches


And I couldn't give a reason

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door


November flush and your flannel cure


""This dorm was once a madhouse""


I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""


How evergreen, our group of friends


Don't think we'll say that word again


And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls


That we once walked through


One for the money, two for the show


I never was ready so I watch you go


Sometimes you just don't know the answer


'Til someone's on their knees and asks you


""She would've made such a lovely bride


What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said


But you'll find the real thing instead


She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

I was dancing when the music stopped


And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention

There'll be happiness after you


But there was happiness because of you

Past the curses and cries


Beyond the terror in the nightfall


Haunted by the look in my eyes


That would've loved you for a lifetime


Leave it all behind

Tell me, when did your winning smile


Begin to look like a smirk?


When did all our lessons start to look like weapons


Pointed at my deepest hurt?

And you know you hurt him too

cowboy like me,evermore (deluxe version),52OkpDsU6MmPx1AwGOb6Ap,275040,"[Verse 1]


And the tennis court was covered up


With some tent-like thing


And you asked me to dance


But I said, ""Dancin' is a dangerous game""


Oh, I thought


This is gonna be one of those things


Now I know


I'm never gonna love again




[Refrain]


I've got some tricks up my sleeve


Takes one to know one


You're a cowboy like me




[Verse 2]


Never wanted love


Just a fancy car


Now I'm waiting by the phone


Like I'm sitting in an airport bar




[Refrain]


You had some tricks up your sleeve


Takes one to know one


You're a cowboy like me[Chorus]


Perched in the dark


Tellin' all the rich folks anything they wanna hear


Like it could be love


I could be the way forward


Only if they pay for it


You're a bandit like me


Eyes full of stars


Hustling for the good life, never thought I'd meet you here


It could be love


We could be the way forward


And I know I'll pay for it




[Chorus]


You're a cowboy like me


Perched in the dark


Tellin' all the rich folks anything they wanna hear


Like it could be love


I could be the way forward


Only if they pay for it


You're a bandit like me


Eyes full of stars


Hustlin' for the good life, never thought I'd meet you here


It could be love


We could be the way forward


And I know I'll pay for it[Bridge]


And the skeletons in both our closets


Plotted hard to fuck this up


And the old men that I've swindled


Really did believe I was the one


And the ladies lunchin' have their stories about


When you passed through town


Oh, but that was all before I locked it down




[Verse 3]


Now you hang from my lips


Like the Gardens of Babylon


With your boots beneath my bed


Forever is the sweetest con




[Refrain]


I've had some tricks up my sleeve


Takes one to know one


You're a cowboy like me




[Outro]


And I'm never gonna love again


I'm never gonna love again


I'm never gonna love again",Calm,0.604,0.517,0,-9.014,1,0.0347,0.768,0.000155,0.123,0.511,127.967,audio_features,52OkpDsU6MmPx1AwGOb6Ap,spotify:track:52OkpDsU6MmPx1AwGOb6Ap,https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/52OkpDsU6MmPx1AwGOb6Ap,https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/52OkpDsU6MmPx1AwGOb6Ap,275040,4

I should've asked you how to be


Asked you to write it down for me


Should've kept every grocery store receipt

Watched as you signed your name Marjorie

Сірий листопад


Я занепала духом із липня


Захоплення руху


Виставило мене у поганому світлі


Я відтворюю свої кроки на кожній сходинці


Намагаючись знайти ту саму, на які усе пішло не так


Пишу листи


Адресовані вогню




[Приспів: Тейлор Свіфт]


І я насилу переводила дух


Пильно дивлячись у відчинене вікно


Змерзала на кістку


І я не могла бути певною


У мене було таке химерне почуття


Що цей біль лишиться


Навіки




[Куплет 2: Тейлор Свіфт]


Гей, грудню


Здається, я почуваю себе не 
у своїй тарілці


Не можу згадати


За що я до цього боролася


Я перемотую 
стрічку
, але вона лише зупиняється


На тому самому моменті, де усе було втрачено


Посилала сигнали


І була зраджена[Приспів: Тейлор Свіфт і Джастін Вернон]


І я насилу переводила дух


Босоніж у найлютішу зиму


Змерзала на кістку


І я не могла бути певною


У мене було таке химерне почуття


Що цей біль лишиться


Навіки


(Навіки)




[Бридж 1: Джастін Вернон]


Не можу не думати про усе, чого це коштувало


І усі ті речі, що будуть втрачені


О, чи можемо ми просто зробити павзу?


Щоб бути впевненими, що ми будем великими знову


Чи то морозна погода


Чи несамовитість найспекотніших днів


Я на хвилях, що метають мене


Чи є межа, яку я можу перетнути?




[Бридж 2: Тейлор Свіфт і Джастін Вернон]


І коли я зазнала корабельної трощі (Не можу думати про усе, чого це коштувало)


Я думала про тебе (Усі речі, що будуть втрачені)


У щілинах зі світлом (Чи можемо ми просто зробити павзу?)


Я мріяла про тебе (Щоб бути впевненими, що ми будем великими знову, якщо ти подумаєш про все, чого це коштувало)


Це було досить реально (Чи то морозна погода)


Щоб допомогти мені пережити це (Чи несамовитість найспекотніших днів)


(Чи несамовитість найспекотніших днів)


(На хвилях, що метають мене)


(Я на хвилях, що метають мене)


Та я присягаюся (Чи є межа, яку ми можемо просто перетнути?)


Ти був там[Приспів: Тейлор Свіфт і Джастін Вернон]


І я насилу переводила дух

right where you left me - bonus track,evermore (deluxe version),3zwMVvkBe2qIKDObWgXw4N,245026,"[Round 1: B. Dot]


Ayo!


B. Dot on URL? Well, it's not a dream


What you heard is real


I'm one of the best in the GAME!


I mean, y'all all heard of the name and observed the skill


I'm feeling like Daylyt vs. Mike P


It's my time to shine 'cause I earned the deal


Except I'm only licking the ground after the shot and his body drop to confirm the kill!


I snuck in a steel Ruger


But still sharp with the hands: the real Kreuger


Aye, I read Rum went to the East with fake J's!


That's backwards: it'll be MURDER if I pull up with real shooters!


Them Piru-ers, and I got some Crip niggas in all blue, homie


As far as weapons, I got a few on me


Aye, it was animated 'til I drew on him


With the long nose that I used to think was despicable...'til it grew on me!


Aye, who want me?


They said a nigga named E.K., he the preacher type


Well, don't believe the hype


You had a whole video running through the streets


But running the streets get niggas locked: that is NOT the key to life


You from Utah!? I'm from Pacoima!


We don't even breathe alike!


For l'il homies in MY hood, whacking out rival gangs is the way they learned to read and write!


My breathing right


I'm 'bout to lock on this nigga like Cujo


He wanna switch sides and switch teams to sell tix?


Aye, do what you do, bro!


Just know the King don't need a PG


I got no problem letting two go!


But you know!


URL tricky: yeah, they lie to the true, bro!


Tricked me into doing a PG


Yeah, they clowned in a loophole


But it's cool, though! Give 'em kudos!


They assisting the new Manute Bol


Thought they was throwing me a bounce pass


I turned this to a alley-oop, though!


You gotta shoot, bro!


Bar Code: a bunch of dirty niggas from the group home


Get beat 'til you're black and blue: whip two tone


If I say we warrin', G, I ain't talking 'bout the nigga that put Snoop on!


These bullets fly for cheap


I could make this count for the whole crew like it's Groupon!


""Aye, B. Dot, what you on!?""


Well, you know how this crowd do it


This URL! You gotta give 'em the same shit


You know, a bunch of ""BOW!"" movements!


Don't tell me that sound stupid, a conscious brother holding a gun


I mean, in order to know where I'm at, don't you niggas gotta know where I'm from?


See, it wasn't always about the ""God raps""


You gotta go beyond that


In order to tell a vision, you gotta channel the inner wisdom, and look at the contrast!


I grew up bangin', but changed my life in a big way


Shout out to Loso!


Just know, though, I saved myself, I ain't get saved


I grew up punching niggas in the mouth for acting bitch-made, and ain't shit changed


You push that right button, that steel slides out like a switchblade!


You 'bout to get sprayed


I mean, you RIGHT IN THE SPOT where your homies got you left out


I was searching the Tube, lurking for views


Scanning the Bar Code, and nothing really checked out!


Diesel, what your rep 'bout?


My niggas from family said you 'bout as good as a ghost


I mean, all you do is troll on Facebook


Now your name makes sense: Diesel was only good in the post!


When I look at you both, nothing really SCREAM y'all clappin' in most cases


I mean, we can try and mask it


But when it come down to the action, bro and son just actin' like Ghostfaces


I mean, fuck a scrap! We can clap!


If you ain't the homie, the lives is getting taken


But if the family feud, we'll put up the tool


The arm can go behind the back before we get it shakin'!


But, for you, you get robbed


The homies shoot with no hesitation


And I'll assist with the jack


Son, we move in unison: Rhythm Nation!


I figured hatin'


So, I brought two straps for the situation


This a Colt, and this'll zip you up for all that tongue: two different Paytons!


Fuck what we sayin'! He only telling truth 'bout a few things!


I mean, E lie, man, and all that giant talk's gon' get you is two rings!


He said he Muslim? Oh, I HEARD he Muslim!?


That's cool, King! Well, I'm here to take what you got


You get robbed on your prayer rug


I heard what you're making's a lot


You gon' be taking these shots, when hollow-tips tarnishin' your fellowship Parliament


Every time you speak, we'll applaud your shit


That just means you'll get clapped for every word, like a ghetto chick arguin'!


I don't CARE if Allah with him!


I got three homies with me, rolling up


And each one got a .44 we clutch


So, that's four .44's, just in case Hova wanna open up!


I throw it up, and let my Killah Bees swarm on him


Feeling like a freak on a leash: I turn Korn on him


Putting these machines together, I transform on him


They saying he got tunnel vision, I blow the HORN on him!


It's MUSIC to my EARS when niggas get stretched out like accordions


According to the gossip, they said you'll hop in an Accord to get away from the shottas


But if we find ya, you'll be in the street, fighting for your LIFE!


You won't believe how many arms we'll have on E Honda!


Time![Round 1: Emerson Kennedy]


That's a classic first round!


And y'all wondering if E write as hard


Maybe not...promise to God I will NEVER have a 
Street Fighter
 bar!


I guarantee it!


B. Dot, what are you in search of? Little fame from this battle rap?


Or do you TRULY require a change in your habitat?


'Cause you an activist on this rapping shit, but how do you prioritize?


Eliminating
 guns and 
illuminating
 guns in all those rounds that you glorify!


Are you really reppin' they word?


I don't have NO gun shit!


I don't have NO gun shit!


Are you really reppin' they word, or just reinforcing the negative lessons they've learned?


When your community ask for action, are you...too busy preppin' for Aye Verb?


Am I wrong, nigga!? Say word!


'Cause you making niggas foreheads' split


While your community losing lives to the same pump you threaten Cortez with!?


Nigga, WHAT?!


That's why yo' conscience is irrelevant


If you just got a gun line for your benefit


That's OVERSIGHT, of trying to be a celebrity OVERNIGHT


All we really hear is the violence through the end of it


Nigga, hold on-!


Catch up! Catch UP!


But I got a story to tell 'bout certain parts of my town


I grew up a screw-up, hypnotized by the cars and the sounds


And now I'm going...going...back to Cali, just to take part of his crown


That didn't even seem hot


I was on my B. Dot: using B.I.G. words to make up for lack of BARS IN HIS ROUNDS!!


Nigga, HOLD ON!


And y'all was starting to doubt him


Traffic, and I wouldn't play a part in this outcome?


I'm sorry, this ain't for the West


It's for the ancestors who never saw Martin vs. Malcolm!


Nigga, hold on!


And the FANS start to tout him


Over at LABG, they said there was something about him


Before Cortez on KOTD, where he rapped 
three rounds of gun lines
, with a little substance at the end


And this who you put faith in to have conscience coming from his pen?


Vers' Danny, he spoke to the Black QUEENS


On just how far choosing the right man could take them


Then, his next time in the ring


He sound like all them niggas he warned y'all to stay AWAY FROM!


And that's why he-


FACTS! 
FACTS!


And that's why he's lost in the noise


Cause that shows the cost of your choice


Your wordplay skill only got you a mermaid deal


Career got legs but 
it lost you your voice
!


Nigga, hold on!


And that's so blatant, and now B. Dot raps so flagrant


You went from ""stay truest"" to Ray Lewis, B. Dot, and that's so Raven


I mean, Smack, why is it ""support the black business"" until it comes to his rap interest?


Cause we've been building up black Smack presence


While he's KOTD and dance sessions


Shuckin' and jivin' for Organik, showin' how B. Dot shoot


Look brother, we supposed to eat organic, not watch him eat off you!


I'mma FUCK HIM UP!


This is Smack, right!? This ain't KOTD!


This ain't KOTD, this is Smack, and I stay with this business


And that mind state was defenseless


You know not to trust crackers with K in the name of they business!


And I was ashamed when I witnessed


You lettin' straps into your speech?


And this was after you had grabbed all the blacks that you could reach


How does an activist flip back to the tactics of the weak


While he's practicing gun bars instead of ""practice what your preach!?""


But he gon' say, ""But I'm not black, I'm just a geek.""


And I never have to prove that curve


But I thought whites calling me ""nigga"" and some niggas from my right to even use that word


You can't use what you used on Verb


No fake threats just to hurt you


I'm glad his third eye open: I plan on swelling shut the first two!


Nigga hold on!


But the aim's not to attack you, the aim's to adapt you


Take his progression as a lesson B. Dot, religion's a vaccum


I was reading math books while he's arguing the book of Matthew


Telling Christian's that Satan's fake and now he's fuckin' lookin' at you!


Charles I just want to ask you


What's it like having a conscious community supportin' your battles?


Or all of Los Angeles in unity that's ready to back you?


If that's embellished it's just cause I'm jealous cause they gon' build B. Dot a statue


And I don't have a nigga to take a bullet for me cause all of them actually had to, nigga hold on!


I was that bad black kid, doin' what the Black Masks did


Passin' rocks in front and back of me: I was the original Backpack Kid


Nigga, hold on!


Nigga I come from the blocks where the cops plantin' somethin' in your spot


So the PG's L.A. football: nigga, you get the charges whether you want them or not!


Nigga, hold on![Round 2: B. Dot]


Here we go again


A nigga get in front of me, get conscious and want to break me down, well we gotta go beyond that


You from Utah, you the most white washed nigga on Smack


But gettin' back to the gangsta shit


I find out where the enemy stay and catch him while he pick up his dame


I mean they in the whip goin' over the pass, you know she ask him about some distant exchange


Well the texts is 'bout to take 'em both back down memory lane


With a head shot, baow!


Oh nah sis' in the back of the whip pickin' Kennedy's brain


I get him with range, I know how to be a sprayer


No forensic files gettin' left, your body gettin' swept, the autopsy missin' data


I'm a hit man tellin' detectives to holla at me later


A clean marksman can aim at the target and get him caught by


Puttin' all these bitchin' in one spot like it's How To Be A Player


With the new silencer


And with that thing on, you barely can hear a sound


With that rubber grip that stop the kickback like your parents came home early from out of town


Look who I found


A fuckin' clown that's half white half black, I'm guessin' that pressure is heavy


Wait, your brain tryin' to rap, you're trapped


Between bein' a college spoiled brat in a frat


Or a young black strapped with a gat, pants saggin' to the back


You're tryin' to blend in wit your raps


In every one of your rounds you attach a reference about one of your niggas who claps


It's always, ""You know it's one of my niggas"" that did this and did that


You're commentatin' on another player game but never give us your stats


You're 'bout to collapse


Don't know if he was sober when he told ya but we can blame this on 'gnac


He sent you on the attack


I'm on the defensive end


Eh, nephew your uncle Tom, Brady 'bout to get sacked


And thanks to The Patriot Act I got the IP address to where the information is stacked


So if it's all in your brain, I'll send somebody Anonymous to get your cranium hacked


Nigga you back?


For what? We been sayin' you wack


Heard you had a vaca' in Iraq


The western conference been on the prowl but somehow you strayed from the pack


Ended up way in the back


I mean way way in the back


Thought he was royalty, Jay with the raps


Well t king dumb, come get faded to black


Nigga you should be faded for that


Tryin' to piggyback off the movement


We had been bangin' for that


Now there's a wide margin between us, I mean it


Keyshia Cole's dentist couldn't bring in the gap


I mean, what happened wit him?


When I got started in the west this was the cat to mention


You was a rappin' henchmen but you been movin' backwards since then


Act indifferent, stagnant, trippin'


Everything about the average written trash you spittin' just lacks conviction


Say you put on for the west but only put on your best when you think it'll get Smack's attention


We just rappin' different


I give a fuck about another nigga name


You claim Jay your idol, well create your own title, don't ride another nigga wave


Nigga you went from a One Off to a PG, you another nigga's slave


You got this backwards, this ain't no PG, I did this off GP, I'm the one that's gettin' paid


Nigga you're gettin' sprayed


Watch how I aim the thing and flame your scene


I turn your world upside down my nigga


It'll be nothin' but ashes and you ain't never seen Stranger Things


I'll have the crew come through with the blade and things


Go across your stomach and shave your spleen


The irony, that tellin' a nigga, ""Aye! If you don't wanna get cut then don't make the team""


I'm amazing king


Why swerve when I'm[?] on a three way street?


Yeah we look at the chart we checked out your heart


I don't wanna hear none of y'all murmur that EK, G


Yeah they checked us at the door but we still got the burners through


Cause we play keeps I had it in the sock


I got the flame near the foot like I'm on a 2K streak


This nigga weak


I don't wanna hear no Black Panther speech


Nigga, yo' bitch is white and you white-washed


Where I'm from, we don't add the bleach


I'll fuck you up


We can catch the fade til my knuckles bust


Bet he buckle up, I pull out that Tay Roc blade


What the fuck is up?


You get in a lucky punch? Good fuckin' luck


You gettin' fuckin' jumped, my niggas will be waitin' to jump in the middle of the swings like double dutch


What the fuck is up?


Aye! URL is where the gangsta shit at


I don't wanna hear all that conscious word today nigga[Round 2: Emerson Kennedy]


He doesn't want me do Panther bars cause I date a Caucasian, you screamed that in my fuckin' face


Well I date a white girl, you get a right curl, we both in the sunken place


Nigga hold on!


He says I'm always sayin' how it's one of my niggas who got the blammer


You right, and an OG taught me never to admit that shit on camera


Nigga hold on


That's two of them thangs


I was carefully drafted in the new wave


Just to conjure a new classic to the page


When they gave me the hope seller, felt like Coachella


Only time I'm not worried about traffic in L.A


You think you've mastered what to say?


So the conscious is thankin' him


You don't support black banks and them, so they won't put me on the rank with him


But that means he's a customer, I'm a hustler


Y'all gon' have to walk plank wit him


For trustin' a nigga that sees Hamilton more than one that sees Franklins


And that's why, and he's bankin' on the fact that it's his knowledge I fear


You talkin' selfies with books lodged to your ear


Is B. Dot's first novel idea


Boy I mix what you call illegal but still mournin' for my people


I ran this check up on KG just to send the money to Puerto Rico


But I'm a man over a thug, right?


But tonight, it's Black African power


Well, tonight, it's another plan


I put a horse head in his bed spread the same shape as the motherland


Nigga hold on


And I'm a man over a thug


Raised by the scammers and the drugs


You ever tripped over your cell phone charger? My niggas really ran up on the plug


Boy forget about the bud, get your mind up out the club


I avoided pig but every meal I had to get up out the mud


And you ain't [?] about the hub


Cause New York got you stressin'


I got a W on that New York stage throwin' W's, nigga reppin'


I beat a Brooklyn nigga in Brooklyn, see that dawg ain't up in you


Cause I flew 6,000 miles to beat a nigga that could walk to the venue


And I stay that way


While you stay at bay


You can't take flight on Kennedy bein' scared to land at JFK


Nigga hold on


See you can't master what is right, until you step out of class to set the fight


All those books you read can't get you past this chapter in your life


See New York tells me they doubtin' you


When I'm there I tell them I'm proud of you


Cause on the east I hold him down, on the west I hold you accountable


Nigga hold on


That's cause I'm loyal to my soil, even when preparin' for battle


Do you believe in Adam and Eve?


Nigga, then why you so scared of The Apple?


And you had to! And B. Dot had to to skip the Proving Ground


He was lettin' the fame hurt you


Don't you know cuttin' corners put you in that same circle?


What a shame? Hurtful


Come to grips with the truth


You'd rather sit on the roof than fight and sit with the troops


You never put mileage on your car, just to put chips on your tooth


You ain't Superman, you Wonder Woman, nigga ya whip tells the truth


Hold on


Boy, stop with the pride and only sendin' shots from this side


Goin' to the east makes you a beast


Only thing you provin' is that you not gonna ride


I proved I won't fold on the road and this is not the 405


B. Dot the only fast track means you gotta have a little box in your drove


You know what I'm sayin'


That was crazy, I'm unbreakable, unfadeable


Your fate? Is replaceable


I'm erasin' the fate of father to show my mom that I'm capable


You chasin' a fade with Saga just to have a debatable


You chase the fade with Saga to show him who he's been prayin' to


I'm a god vs a facade who won't put the ratchets down


Y'all cheer him talkin' 'bout blastin' rounds


I'm only empowerin' caps and gowns


See we had masters then I got my masters, I turned that back around


We was brought here on slave ships...look at me, I'm the captain now


They gon' capture your rounds and turn it into a clip that goes viral


B. Dot in ten years they gon' capture my rounds and turn it into a bible!


This ain't even a rival


They say the teachers incredible because of the reach on the pedestal and how he speak to the head of you


I never been a teacher's pet, you see you leeches is terrible


Go ahead and bring him an apple I'm just gon' leave him a vegestable


And that's how I achieve, what I achieve is incredible


Where they find me at?


....Is that time? No, this is the West, nigga, gimme my time to rap!


Hold on


I was homeless in a hooptie: rusty Pontiac


All hunger with no slumber, you know how your conscious act


When you skip sleepin' for a weekend, you just stuck in the car and rap


What I'm sayin' is: Don't talk that woke shit to a fuckin' insomniac


Nigga the bomb is back!




[Round 3: B. Dot]


You know what though? EK, this ain't even about competition


Look my nigga you charged with bein' a slave to the URL system


Think of this as a film inquisition


I'm 'bout to give you a chance to make sure you don't dance around these topics during your deposition


True or false: you flew to the east on your own cost


Battled Jerry Wess then lost


Was supposed to be the future, with the Mask on


Smokin'


But ended up bein' regular Jim Carrey with it off


Then you never got the call


That couldn't happen to me I'm very much a boss


They didn't want me to battle Cor'


They said, ""Well make him give you the other half back""


Lyin', that's a battle they couldn't block


Then they tried to change the pitch but I already scored six, shit I'm Barry with the toss


Against Cali, you went off, but you still wasn't on


I mean you battled YK in The Bay they say you tried to stay a bit too long


I mean they told you when to go, stupid


Ya dumb? They wasn't playin' you a song


This ain't just about you there's a few involved


West coast niggas, what they do to y'all?


This ain't food for thought


I mean it's stickin' to the plate just so they can say, ""Aye! Y'all sleep on it we'll get it off at the break of dawn.""


That's when your brain gets washed


What's what we came here for?


Now you niggas switchin' ya ways while I'm still N.W.A


I'm sure y'all remember them days


Imagine if Eazy, Dre or Ren would've say ""This L.A. shit ain't gettin' us paid. We need to switch up and change.""


Nah, instead they paved the way, created lanes for all the shit that we say


Ain't nothin' different today


We could've done the same thing with battle rap


Instead y'all folded, let out-of-towners come in and promote it


Now, we don't even got a hand in that


We could've won L.A


By ourselves we could've got this done L.A


But y'all kept sayin' we needed AIDS so they sent the nigga from Michigan to come run LA


This could've been Magic


Instead it's URL: Traffic


Tragic


But hold on to this, grasp it


This the closest y'all gon' get to a west coast Summer Madness


Then I'm passed this


I'm just up here statin' the facts


This is the cheapest I've ever been paid for a match


But I thank you for that


I ain't like I'm some king on the throne


I just guess King Of The Dot treated me the same way y'all treated Charron


You know a white boy with confederate flags wavin' a Mag is what you condone


But got me up here in front of this Utah nigga talkin' all this Jazz


While my stock ten times better than his and he's assisting Malone?


""Well, you know, Charron, he skipped the PG's cause he built his prestige as a rapper.""


""Yeah on King Of The Dot, I thought this was the only league that matters.""


""Oh you know with Charron he got millions of views when we tallied up the amount.""


""Yeah on King Of The Dot. I thought this was the only league that counts.""


What is this really about?


Is this some ego thing cause y'all dealin' with a nigga wit' clout?


Cause I led the league with the greatest perception without a pass from y'all cause I stuck to my routes?


Oh I figured you out


I'm supposed to be happy to be on this stage, of course you Smack


Look, I support black business but black business gotta support you back


Back in the PG's just happy to be promoted


Y'all notice he retired from battle rap, got rehired by Smack but then demoted


You bogus


You up here sleep walkin', losin' focus


I'm swingin' on you, left and right, you gettin' clocked out of hypnosis


But let's focus


On these money hungry league owners


Beasley had a problem with Diz' sayin' ""nigga""...well that's what he told us


But let's expose this cause I was like ""Oh that's wild""


I guess as long as you gettin' Money Bagz you'll allow a white boy to say ""nigga"" on your stage in front of an all black crowd


Shit is foul


And y'all don't see the manipulation


I mean your fans don't ever say shit


Look, I rock with Roc but even look how they plan Tay shit


They got him locked up caged in


Can't go to the other leagues and get the cheese, that don't make sense


I mean, is he being rewarded


Or is this the same trick that got us boarded on the slave ship from that European invasion


Capitalism, they ain't change it


The old master say, ""You niggas ain't goin' nowhere""


New masters say, ""It only matters on this plantation.""


This is basic and y'all don't even think to condemn it


Yeah they tell you you a free slave until they hit you with that Thirteenth Ammendment


Then your ass stuck in prison lookin' for a deacon or a pastor


Look, I don't know what's worse, workin' for the white man or workin' for your black brother that think he your master


I'm just closin' this chapter


Ain't no turnin' back for me


I did this for Loso, Jimz and all of them that don't have to do this after me


I mean, don't lose your integrity lettin' these niggas lock you down


Claimin' the PG is the master key


I'm from the west, I'm only here to see Dizaster tweek


Ayo Roc, I hope they paid you a lot my nigga cause LA gas ain't cheap


This is the west! We started gangsta rap, I'm gon' need our thanks for that


Yeah I know the east started rap, cool, we not claimin' that


But if URL is about gang bangin' slangin' crack and bangin' straps


Well then bitch, LA is where it should be stationed at!




[Round 3: Emerson Kennedy]


If you had that big of a problem with Smack....


Why didn't you start your black business and hit us with that grown talk?


He's gon' say, ""I was busy. I was...it's Charron fault.""


Hold on nigga, hold on


B. Dot we got shit to work through and the aim is never to hurt you


But can we reverse to, your verse two angle, on that Verb tangle


When you said some shit I took a little personal


How you said Aye Verb's daddy struck his mama and that's what changed his identity


Cause he was then raised by that single mama and that's why the change in femininity


But what about the change in yo' energy?


I mean, when did your tales of talkin' get derailed so often?


When did domestic abuse become B. Dot's next best excuse to call a nigga frail and mock him?


When did callin' Verb ""gay"" for two rounds just cause a female had taught him


Outweigh the significance of a female raisin' a nigga that's not in jail or a coffin


Cause I was single mother raised and I got memories of pops hittin' on her


But when you downplay single mother's success that's you just shittin' on her


See you said Verb got head rolls and finger snaps




[B. Dot]


Facts. He did




[Emerson Kennedy]


But that to me was kind of scary


Cause that black woman stereotype is only used by Fox News and Tyler Perry


And that's why I'm kinda leery, and dissecting what you did


You preferred Verb's mom parasailing, niggas shiftin' through the crib


So when Verb's a little kid, he's got father figures now


But they just fuck moms and tuck arms so Verb won't put the trigger down


And now he's grabbin' weapons in adolescence and if that don't put him in the ground


The fate he earns, the trait he learned from them and that's to never stick around


And then that cycle starts over, and that night you became that promoter


When you went at Verb's weight and dismissed the weight that's on his mother's shoulders


See I don't even know if he like knew you


But that made me wonder if B. Dot truthful


Cause sayin' a female would raise a trans-parent made me see right through you


Nigga hold on


See I'm not just teachin' lessons


But you sayin' females suggest the affection of a boy


It's not toys, the biggest gift you give as a parent is just bein' present


And that's all that should matter


But your antiquated thoughts confuse the data


Cause you only have the perspective of a male and no mom but that's what causes the cancer


And you supposed to have the thoughts of a Panther, but your words hold us back


See masculinity ain't man's destiny to shoot fades or hold a strap


It's just being comfortable with who you are, but you drifted far from knowin' that


See men treat all with respect but check niggas who don't show it back


Don't think I ain't notice that


All that hate you was tellin' him


I think it's significant B. Dot, can't embrace what is feminine


So if you have a prescription to his diction just cause he speaks about race and the melanin


Just remember, never trust a doctor who don't like the taste of his own medicine


And that's why I'm ahead of him


Cause I know the [?] of a father


I prefer Terrance have two parents, but I know that raisin' is harder


I took care of my sis' hurtin' when moms was workin' and couldn't embrace one of her daughters


So bein' raised by a woman didn't make me woman, nigga it made me a father!


So hold on


It made me a father, I had to embrace what was harder


But you speakin' on punk shit, your female fans should jump ship


For takin' that angle on young kids


Versus Danny you told women who to date and who not to fuck wit


I'm just tellin' those women who looks down on him and who really up lifts


Diesel brings his daughter to my crib


And we let her just draw, right?


We don't talk gang shit, we watch our language cause he knows that's how she's best off


So similar to when these niggas hop in each other's battles


Say one line to prevent loss


....


If something happens to Diesel I pick up right where you left off


Nigga and that's facts


And that's why you just lost


Cause you tryin' to walk that fine line of black activist/Einstein


And using gay angles from Grind Time


When Lux said ""yo' pops ain't no gangsta"", that one stayed on my mind


Cause he said ""He's just another lost nigga"" and I spent years tryin' to find mine


But hold on, that's just the luck of the stuck


And being in a rut as a mutt


Maybe you're right, I didn't have a father to toughen me up


Cause I get emotional when you insinuate that my mother's a crutch


Cause my mother raised a nigga that's currently fuckin' you up!


Nigga that's right


And I know that this battle shit confuses you


But I'm a fan of B. Dot cause I feel battle rap is in a jam


I was hopin' he'd 3-0 me


I know to be the GOAT sometime you gotta be the sacrificial lamb

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night


Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife


And if it was an open-shut case


I never would've known from that look on your face


Lost in your current like a priceless wine




[Chorus]


The more that you say, the less I know


Wherever you stray, I follow


I'm begging for you to take my hand


Wreck my plans, that's my man




[Verse 2]


Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind


Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in


As if you were a mythical thing


Like you were a trophy or a champion ring


And there was one prize I'd cheat to win




[Chorus]


The more that you say, the less I know


Wherever you stray, I follow


I'm begging for you to take my hand


Wreck my plans, that's my man


You know that my train could take you home


Anywhere else is hollow


I'm begging for you to take my hand


Wreck my plans, that's my man[Bridge]


Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind


They count me out time and time again


Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind


But I come back stronger than a '90s trend




[Verse 3]


Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark


Show me the places where the others gave you scars


Now this is an open-shut case


I guess I should've known from the look on your face


Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

You booked the night train for a reason


So you could sit there in this hurt


Bustling crowds or silent sleepers


You're not sure which is worse

Crestfallen on the landing


Champagne problems


Your mom's ring in your pocket


My picture in your wallet

You told your family for a reason


You couldn't keep it in


Your sister splashed out on the bottle


Now no one's celebrating

Dom Pérignon, you brought it


No crowd of friends applauded


Your hometown skeptics called it

You had a speech, you're speechless


Love slipped beyond your reaches


And I couldn't give a reason


Champagne problems[Bridge]


Your Midas touch on the Chevy door


November flush and your flannel cure


""This dorm was once a madhouse""


I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""


How evergreen, our group of friends


Don't think we'll say that word again


And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls


That we once walked through


One for the money, two for the show


I never was ready so I watch you go


Sometimes you just don't know the answer


'Til someone's on their knees and asks you


""She would've made such a lovely bride


What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said


But you'll find the real thing instead


She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

Everybody wants you


But I don't like a gold rush

With your hair falling into place like dominoes


I see me padding across your wooden floors


With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door

And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nеver seen a love as pure as it


And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea

And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it

If I wanted to know who you were hanging with


While I was gone, I would've asked you


It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass


But I felt it when I passed you


There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me


But if it's all the same to you


It's the same to me

And thе school that used to be ours


The holidays linger like bad perfume


You can run, but only so far


I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave


But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me

And wonder about the only soul


Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'


And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own


To leave the warmest bed I've ever known

But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given


Is just shit we're dividin' up


Showed you all of my hiding spots


I was dancing when the music stopped


And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention


I haven't met the new me yet




[Chorus]


There'll be happiness after you


But there was happiness because of you


Both of these things can be true


There is happiness




[Post-Chorus]


Past the blood and bruise


Past the curses and cries


Beyond the terror in the nightfall


Haunted by the look in my eyes


That would've loved you for a lifetime


Leave it all behind


And there is happiness




[Verse 2]


Tell me, when did your winning smile


Begin to look like a smirk?


When did all our lessons start to look like weapons


Pointed at my deepest hurt?


I hope she'll be a beautiful fool


Who takes my spot next to you


No, I didn't mean that


Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury


You haven't met the new me yet[Chorus]

But there was happiness because of me

From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind


And there is happiness

I can't make it go away by making you a villain


I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven


And I pulled your body into mine


Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties


No one teaches you what to do


When a good man hurts you


And you know you hurt him too




[Verse 3]


Honey, when I'm above the trees


I see it for what it is


But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head


After giving you the best I had


Tell me what to give after that


All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness


You haven't met the new me yet


And I think she'll give you that[Chorus]

Prelomim si dušo na pol ko te iščem


A si prav tukaj


Če se ne morem več poistovetiti s tabo


S kom sem torej v sorodu?


In če je to dolg hodnik


Kako sva prišla sem tako hitro?


Sem dlan zaprla okoli nečesa krhkega?


Sem te zlomila?




[Refren: Taylor Swift]


In sedim na klopci na Coney Island-u


Sprašujem se, kam je šel moj ljubi?


Hitri časi, svetle luči, vrtiljak


Oprosti, ker nisi bil sredina moje knjige


Spet in spet


Izgubljena, nobenih presenečenj


Razočaranja, zapri oči


In postaja bolj in bolj mrzlo


Ko sonce zaide




[Verz 2: Matt Berninger 
s Taylor Swift
]


Vprašanjе razbija v moji glavi


Kaj je življenje uspеhov


Če sem te porinil do roba


A si bila preveč vljudna, da bi me zapustila?


In ali pogrešaš kriminalca


Ki te je pregovoril, da prideš v raj in te pustil tam samo?


Boš oprostila moji duši


Ko boš prepameten(a), da bi zaupal(a) in prestar(a), da bi ti bilo mar?[Refren: Taylor Swift 
z Matt-om Berninger-om
]


Ker bila sva kot nakupovalno središče pred internetom


To je bil kraj, kjer si moral biti


Navihanost, v darilni papir zavite predmestne sanje


Oprosti, ker ti nisem zadel(a) prstana v igralnici


Spet in spet


Izgubljena, nobenih presenečenj


Razočaranja, zapri oči


In postaja bolj in bolj hladno


Ko sonce zaide




[Mostiček: Taylor Swift, 
Matt Berninger
, 
Oba
]


Si čakal na najinem starem kraju


Pri vrsti dreves pri zlati uri


Kjer sem te pustila čakati vsak dan?


Si čakala na hodniku


Z veliko torto, vse najboljše


Sem tvoje modro nebo obarvala temno sivo?


Eno univerzo stran


In ko sem bila udeležen v nesreči


Se je pred mano prikazal tvoj obraz


A ko sem odšla na oder


Mislim, da sem pozabila reči tvoje ime




[Refren: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]


In sedim na klopci na Coney Island-u


Sprašujem se, kam je šel moj ljubi?


Hitri časi, svetle luči, vrtiljak


Oprosti, ker nisi bil sredina moje knjige


Spet in spet


Izgubljena, nobenih presenečenj


Razočaranja, zapri oči


In postaja bolj in bolj mrzlo


Ko sonce zaide[Zaključek: Taylor Swift & Matt Berninger]


Ko sonce zaide


Se je pred mano prikazal tvoj obraz


Ko sonce zaide


A mislim, da sem pozabil(a) reči tvoje ime


Spet in spet


Oprosti, ker nisi bil(a), nisi bil(a)

How's one to know?


I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones


In a faith-forgotten land


In from the snow


Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow


Tarnished but so grand




[Pre-Chorus]


And the old widow goes to the stone every day


But I don't, I just sit here and wait


Grieving for the living




[Chorus]


Oh, goddamn


My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand


Taking mine, but it's been promised to another


Oh, I can't


Stop you putting roots in my dreamland


My house of stone, your ivy grows


And now I'm covered in you




[Verse 2]


I wish to know


The fatal flaw that makes you long to be


Magnificently cursed


He's in the room


Your opal eyes are all I wish to see


He wants what's only yours[Chorus]


Oh, goddamn


My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand


Taking mine, but it's been promised to another


Oh, I can't


Stop you putting roots in my dreamland


My house of stone, your ivy grows


And now I'm covered




[Verse 3]


Clover blooms in the fields


Spring breaks loose, the time is near


What would he do if he found us out?


Crescent moon, coast is clear


Spring breaks loose, but so does fear


He's gonna burn this house to the ground


How's one to know?


I'd live and die for moments that we stole


On begged and borrowed time


So tell me to run


Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become


And drink my husband's wine




[Chorus]


Oh, goddamn


My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand


Taking mine, but it's been promised to another


Oh, I can't


Stop you putting roots in my dreamland


My house of stone, your ivy grows


And now I'm covered in you


And I'm covered in you[Bridge]


So yeah, it's a fire


It's a goddamn blaze in the dark


And you started it


You started it


So yeah, it's a war


It's the goddamn fight of my life


And you started it


You started it




[Chorus]


Oh, I can't


Stop you putting roots in my dreamland


My house of stone, your ivy grows


And now I'm covered


In you, in you


Now I'm covered in you

And the tennis court was covered up


With some tent-like thing


And you asked me to dance


But I said, ""Dancin' is a dangerous game""


Oh, I thought


This is gonna be one of those things


Now I know


I'm never gonna love again




[Refrain]


I've got some tricks up my sleeve


Takes one to know one


You're a cowboy like me




[Verse 2]


Never wanted love


Just a fancy car


Now I'm waiting by the phone


Like I'm sitting in an airport bar




[Refrain]


You had some tricks up your sleeve


Takes one to know one


You're a cowboy like me[Chorus]


Perched in the dark


Tellin' all the rich folks anything they wanna hear


Like it could be love


I could be the way forward


Only if they pay for it


You're a bandit like me


Eyes full of stars


Hustling for the good life, never thought I'd meet you here


It could be love


We could be the way forward


And I know I'll pay for it




[Chorus]


You're a cowboy like me


Perched in the dark


Tellin' all the rich folks anything they wanna hear


Like it could be love

Only if they pay for it


You're a bandit like me


Eyes full of stars


Hustlin' for the good life, never thought I'd meet you here


It could be love


We could be the way forward


And I know I'll pay for it[Bridge]


And the skeletons in both our closets


Plotted hard to fuck this up


And the old men that I've swindled


Really did believe I was the one


And the ladies lunchin' have their stories about


When you passed through town


Oh, but that was all before I locked it down




[Verse 3]


Now you hang from my lips


Like the Gardens of Babylon


With your boots beneath my bed


Forever is the sweetest con

Never be so kind


You forget to be clever


Never be so clever


You forget to be kind




[Pre-Chorus]


And if I didn't know better


I'd think you were talking to me now


If I didn't know better


I'd think you were still around




[Chorus]


What died didn't stay dead


What died didn't stay dead


You're alive, you're alive in my head


What died didn't stay dead


What died didn't stay dead


You're alive, so alive




[Verse 2]


Never be so politе


You forget your power


Nevеr wield such power


You forget to be polite[Pre-Chorus]


And if I didn't know better


I'd think you were listening to me now


If I didn't know better


I'd think you were still around

You're alive, you're alive in my head


What died didn't stay dead


What died didn't stay dead


You're alive, so alive

You loved the amber skies so much


Long limbs and frozen swims


You'd always go past where our feet could touch


And I complained the whole way there


The car ride back and up the stairs


I should've asked you questions


I should've asked you how to be


Asked you to write it down for me


Should've kept every grocery store receipt


'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me


Watched as you signed your name Marjorie


All your closets of backlogged dreams


And how you left them all to me[Chorus]


What died didn't stay dead


What died didn't stay dead


You're alive, you're alive in my head


What died didn't stay dead


What died didn't stay dead


You're alive, so alive

Сірий листопад


Я занепала духом із липня


Захоплення руху


Виставило мене у поганому світлі

Намагаючись знайти ту саму, на які усе пішло не так


Пишу листи


Адресовані вогню

Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny


Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis


Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money


And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcée do it?""


The wedding was charming, if a little gauche


There's only so far new money goes


They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""


Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud


The doctor had told him to settle down


It must have been her fault his heart gave out

And they said


""There goes the last great American dynasty


Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been


There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen


She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever


Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city


Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names


And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet


And losing on card game bets with Dalí[Chorus]

""There goes the last great American dynasty

Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea


And in a feud with her neighbor


She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green

Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits


And then it was bought by me

Could've followed my fears all the way down

They told me all of my cages were mental


So I got wasted like all my potential


And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad

Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here


Pouring out my heart to a stranger

Hood over your head, keep your eyes down

Ends with meetings in parking lots

That you picked out just for him


So you leave no trace behind

Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny


Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis


Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money


And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcée do it?""


The wedding was charming, if a little gauche


There's only so far new money goes


They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""


Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud


The doctor had told him to settle down


It must have been her fault his heart gave out




[Chorus]


And they said


""There goes the last great American dynasty


Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been


There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen


She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever


Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city


Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names


And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet


And losing on card game bets with Dalí[Chorus]

""There goes the last great American dynasty

Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea


And in a feud with her neighbor


She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green

Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits


And then it was bought by me

Getting lunch down by the Lakes


She said I looked like an American singer[Chorus]


Time, mystical time


Cutting me open, then healing me fine


Were there clues I didn't see?


And isn't it just so pretty to think


All along there was some


Invisible string


Tying you to me?


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh




[Bridge]


A string that pulled me


Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar


Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire


Chains around my demons


Wool to brave the seasons


One single thread of gold


Tied me to you




[Verse 3]


Cold was the steel of my axe to grind


For the boys who broke my heart


Now I send their babies presents


Gold was the color of the leaves


When I showed you around Centennial Park


Hell was the journey, but it brought me heaven[Chorus]


Time, wondrous time


Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies


And it's cool, b
aby, with me


And isn't it just so pretty to think


All along there was some


Invisible string


Tying you to me?

My heart, my hips, my body, my love


Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch


Gave up on me like I was a bad drug


Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club


Our songs, our films, united we stand


Our country, guess it was a lawless land


Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand


Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans


My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust


Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up


Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough


But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts




[Chorus]


I get drunk, but it's not enough


'Cause you're not my baby


I look through the windows of this love


Even though we boarded them up


Chandelier's still flickering here


'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not


No, it's not


It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)[Post-Chorus]


Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch


My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)


But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

I take the long way home


I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright

You know I love a London boy

Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride


Babes, don't threaten me with a good time[Pre-Chorus]


They say, ""Home is where the heart is""

Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long


And you understand the good and bad end up in the song


For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease


For all my flaws, paranoia and insecurities


I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny

I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on


I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run


Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides


Look now, the sky is gold


I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home




[Chorus]


I don't know why all the trees change in the fall


But I know you're not scared of anything at all


Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away


But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now


And don't know how my friends could be so mean


I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys


And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away


And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names




[Chorus]


I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school


But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you


Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay


But I know I had the best day with you today[Bridge]


I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger


God smiles on my little brother, inside and out


He's better than I am


I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run


And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three


You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me


It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs


And Daddy's smart


And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now, I know why all the trees change in the fall


I know you were on my side even when I was wrong

For staying back and watching me shine

While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away


Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time

Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know

And the story's got dust on every page

Teardrops On My Guitar - Radio Single Remix,reputation Stadium Tour Surprise Song Playlist,7eGeUVeCEvEQrivmjl9Qn3,204706,"Becca:
 Celebration, a week of milestones. We are revisiting all of Taylor Swift's albums and celebrating their anniversaries. It's the twelfth year anniversary of Taylor Swift's debut album and we are playing all of the tracks off of her debut album, which came out October 24th, 2006. I know a lot of people could relate to this song. Taylor said, ""You know what? The guy at the time probably didn't know how I felt, but he did after this song came out.""




Taylor Swift:
 It's a song that I wrote about this guy who I had a big crush on, sat next to me in class, and he would come in to talk about his girlfriend every single day, and how pretty she was and how happy they were, and I never told him that I liked him, but I did write a song with his name in it, so, um, I guess the secret's out now. You know, that song is really about hiding how you really feel.




Becca:
 Yeah, I'd say the cat was definitely out of the bag after that one. And you know, the thing about Taylor Swift's song, ""Teardrops On My Guitar,"" it was so relatable to so many people, as are so many of Taylor Swift's songs.

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors


It's the mornin' of your very first day


You say ""hi"" to your friends you ain't seen in a while


Try and stay out of everybody's way


It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here


For the next four years in this town


Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say


""You know, I haven't seen you around before""




[Chorus]


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you


You're gonna believe them


And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out


Well, count to ten, take it in


This is life before you know who you're gonna be


Fifteen




[Verse 2]


You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail


And soon enough, you're best friends


Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool


We'll be outta here as soon as we can


And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car


And you're feelin' like flyin'


And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one


And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends


When the night ends[Chorus]


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you


You're gonna believe them


And when you're fifteen and your first kiss


Makes your head spin 'round


But in your life, you'll do things greater than


Dating the boy on the football team


But I didn't know it at fifteen




[Bridge]


When all you wanted was to be wanted


Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now


Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday


But I realized some bigger dreams of mine


And Abigail gave everything she had


To a boy who changed his mind


And we both cried




[Chorus]


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you


You're gonna believe them


And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall


I've found time can heal most anything


And you just might find who you're supposed to be


I didn't know who I was supposed to be

I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street


Braced myself for the goodbye


'Cause that's all I've ever known


Then you took me by surprise


You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""[Chorus]


You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water


And every time I look at you, it's like the first time


I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter


She is the best thing that's ever been mine""

And we took a wrong turn


And we fell down a rabbit hole

'Cause nothing's as it seems


And spinning out of control

Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?


Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?

Time moved too fast, you play it back

Pauses, then says ""You're my best friend""

I Know Places - Voice Memo,1989 (Deluxe Edition),4JQm7ebhsrt10wmrP6AfXL,216333,"So over the years, a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end


How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing


So what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways


So I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together




I sent this voice memo to 
Ryan Tedder
 because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time


So I always wanna be prepared


I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said ""I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else""


So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called ""
I Know Places
""


So this was the voice memo that I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song




""Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:




Uh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i


Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i


Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i




Na na na na waiting at the back door


They're around and the vultures come around


And you know that they won't, they won't us


Say what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us


And you come and sing and listen


I would not think about it but I'm not done


Every know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I




'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes


And guns


They are the hunters we are the foxes


And we run


Baby, I know some places we won't be found


And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down


'Cause I, I know places we can hide


I know places, I know places




Uh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, know places""




Or whatever


I don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark lyric, like, bridge thing and it's about, like, everybody's, like, trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever, and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus


So I hope you like it, it wouldn't be a piano thing


It would be, like, [*vocalizing*]


Like, very, like, beat. Now I'm just making weird sounds


Hope you like it!",Sad,0.592,0.128,9,-17.932,0,0.589,0.829,0.0,0.527,0.15,78.828,audio_features,4JQm7ebhsrt10wmrP6AfXL,spotify:track:4JQm7ebhsrt10wmrP6AfXL,https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/4JQm7ebhsrt10wmrP6AfXL,https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/4JQm7ebhsrt10wmrP6AfXL,216333,4
I Wish You Would - Voice Memo,1989 (Deluxe Edition),4TtyvyI42C0KFnbDZvNC8Y,107133,"This is another way I've written songs recently


This is a song I did with 
Jack Antonoff
, and Jack is one of my friends and so we were hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes ""I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds.""


And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said ""Please, please let me have that. Let me play with it, like send it to me""


And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called ""
I Wish You Would
"", because Jack wrote back and said ""I love that""


So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:




Okay so this is an idea called ""I Wish You Would"". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hates him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic.

It's 2 am, in your car


Windows down, past my street the memories start


It's in the past


You drive straight ahead


You thinking that I hate you now


'Cause you still don't know what I never said




I wish you would come back


Wish I never hung up the phone like I did


I wish you knew that

Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good


I wish you would

 and what we like to do is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything we're doing when we're putting a song together, just in case one of us blurts out a cool melody and then we forget about it, we wanna go back and then-and replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves what exactly we were saying


Um, so I brought in this idea called ""Blank Space,"" and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're shouting out these proju— production ideas like, you know the ""Oh!"" at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song


So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called ""Blank Space.""

And I left my scarf there at your sister's house


And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate


Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place


And I can picture it after all these days

That magic's not here no more


And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me


Wind in my hair, I was there


I remember it all too well

You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed


And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team


You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me[Pre-Chorus]

There was nothing else I could do


And I forget about you long enough

Maybe I asked for too much


But maybe this thing was a masterpiece

So casually cruel in the name of being honest

Too well[Verse 4]


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it


I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it


After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own


Now, you mail back my things and I walk home alone


But you keep my old scarf from that very first week


'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me


You can't get rid of it

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45


Picked me up, late one night out the window

The night we snuck into a yacht club party


Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And the organ starts to play


A song that sounds like a death march


And I am hiding in the curtains


It seems that I was uninvited


By your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle


Like a pageant queen


But I know you wish it was me


You wish it was me (Don't you?)

Of the church at the back door


Don't wait or say a single vow


You need to hear me out

Don't say yes, run away now


I'll meet you when you're out


Of the church at the back door


Don't wait or say a single vow


Your time is running out


And they said ""speak now""[Interlude]


Ooh, la-da-da-da, oh


Ooh, ooh


(Say a single vow)




[Bridge]


I hear the preacher say


""Speak now or forever hold your peace""


There's the silence, there's my last chance


I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me


Horrified looks from everyone in the room


But I'm only looking at you




[Verse 3]


I am not the kind of girl


Who should be rudely barging in


On a white veil occasion


But you are not the kind of boy


Who should be marrying the wrong girl




[Chorus]


Don't say yes, run away now


I'll meet you when you're out


Of the church at the back door


Don't wait or say a single vow


You need to hear me out


And they said ""speak now""[Chorus - Variation]


And you’ll say


""Let's run away now


I'll meet you when


I'm out of my tux at the back door""

So glad you were around when they said

Lit through the darkness at 1:58


The words that you whispered for just us to know


You told me you loved me


So why did you go away?


Away

I do recall now, the smell of the rain


Fresh on the pavement


I ran off the plane


That July ninth


The beat of your heart


It jumps through your shirt


I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go


Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes


All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss

I never imagined we'd end like this


Your name, forever the name on my lips[Verse 3]


I still remember the swing of your step


The life of the party, you're showing off again


And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in


I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did


Because I love your handshake, meeting my father


I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets


How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something


There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

Just to ask them how you are


Hope it's nice where you are


And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day


And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed


You can plan for a change in weather and time


But I never planned on you changing your mind[Pre-Chorus]

Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes

My days once revolved around you


Counting my footsteps


Praying the floor won't fall through again


And my mother accused me of losing my mind


But I swore I was fine


You paint me a blue sky


Then go back and turn it to rain


And I lived in your chess game


But you changed your rules everyday


Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight


Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone


Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

Well maybe it's me


And my blind optimism to blame


Or maybe it's you and your sick need


To give love and take it away


And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors


Who don't understand


And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said


""Run as fast as you can""[Chorus]

Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

To be played by your dark, twisted games

And keeping the lines blurry


Never impressed by me acing your tests

I'm shining like fireworks

But with you, I know it's no good


And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would




[Chorus]


Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain


Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain


'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down


Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around


'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile[Bridge]


I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild


Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right


And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?


I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show




[Chorus]


Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain


Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain


'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down


Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around


'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Back To December,Speak Now (Deluxe Edition),7lxADouiWFkwR7ZV2GKUcH,293026,"[Verse 1]


I'm so glad you made time to see me


How's life? Tell me, how's your family?


I haven't seen them in a while


You've been good, busier than ever


We small talk, work and the weather


Your guard is up and I know why




[Pre-Chorus]


Because the last time you saw me


Is still burned in the back of your mind


You gave me roses and I left them there to die




[Chorus]


So this is me swallowing my pride


Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""


And I go back to December all the time


It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you


Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine


I go back to December, turn around and make it alright


I go back to December all the time




[Verse 2]


These days, I haven't been sleeping


Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'


When your birthday passed and I didn't call


Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times


I watched you laughing from the passenger side


And realized I loved you in the fall[Pre-Chorus]


And then the cold came, the dark days


When fear crept into my mind


You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye




[Chorus]


So this is me swallowing my pride


Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""


And I go back to December all the time


It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you


Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine


I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind


I go back to December all the time




[Bridge]


I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile


So good to me, so right


And how you held me in your arms that September night


The first time you ever saw me cry


Maybe this is wishful thinkin'


Probably mindless dreaming


But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right


I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't


So, if the chain is on your door, I understand




[Chorus]


But this is me swallowing my pride


Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""


And I go back to December


It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you


Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I am not the kind of girl


Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion


But you are not the kind of boy

And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel


And she is yelling at a bridesmaid


Somewhere back inside a room


Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be


I lose myself in a daydream

Fond gestures are exchanged


And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march


And I am hiding in the curtains


It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be[Pre-Chorus]


She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen


But I know you wish it was me


You wish it was me, don't you?

""Speak now or forever hold your peace""

Horrified looks from everyone in the room

Long were the nights when


My days once revolved around you


Counting my footsteps


Praying the floor won't fall through again


And my mother accused me of losing my mind


But I swore I was fine


You paint me a blue sky


Then go back and turn it to rain


And I lived in your chess game


But you changed the rules everyday


Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight


Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why




[Chorus]


Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone


Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?


The girl in the dress cried the whole way home


I should've known




[Verse 2]


Well, maybe it's me


And my blind optimism to blame


Or maybe it's you and your sick need


To give love and take it away


And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors


Who don't understand


And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said


""Run as fast as you can""[Chorus]


Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone


Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?


The girl in the dress cried the whole way home


Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong


Don't you think nineteen's too young


To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?


I should've known




[Bridge]


You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry


Never impressed by me acing your tests


All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes


'Cause you burned them out


But I took your matches before fire could catch me


So don't look now


I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town


Oh, oh

And your wildfire lies and your humiliation


You have pointed out my flaws again

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list


She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it


I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling and


She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things


But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know


Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go

But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

Lit through the darkness at 1:58


The words that you whispered for just us to know


You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?


Away

I do recall now, the smell of the rain


Fresh on the pavement
, 
I ran off the plane


That July ninth, the beat of your heart


It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms




[Pre-Chorus]


But now I'll go


Sit on the floor wearing your clothes


All that I know is I don't know


How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have a last kiss


I never imagined we'd end like this


Your name, forever the name on my lips




[Verse 3]


I do remember the swing of your step


The life of the party, you're showing off again


And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in


I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did


Because I love your handshake, meeting my father


I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets


How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something


There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions[Pre-Chorus]

And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day


And something reminds you you wish you had stayed


You can plan for a change in the weather and time

I said, ""Remember this moment""


In the back of my mind


The time we stood with our shaking hands


The crowds in stands went wild


We were the kings and the queens


And they read off our names


The night you danced like you knew our lives


Would never be the same


You held your head like a hero


On a history book page


It was the end of a decade


But the start of an age




[Chorus]


Long live the walls we crashed through


How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you


I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""


And bring on all the 
pretenders


One day, we will be remembered




[Verse 2]


I said, ""Remember this feeling""


I pass the pictures around


Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines


Wishing for right now


We are the kings and the queens


You traded your baseball cap for a crown


When they gave us our trophies


And we held them up for our town


And the cynics were outraged


Screaming, ""This is absurd""


'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves


In ripped up jeans got to rule the world[Chorus]


Long live the walls we crashed through


How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you


I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""


And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid


Long live all the mountains we moved


I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you


I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""


And bring on all the pretenders


One day, we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around


Confetti falls to the ground


May these memories break our fall


Will you take a moment? Promise me this


That you'll stand by me forever


But if, God forbid, fate should step in


And force us into a goodbye


If you have children some day


When they point to the pictures


Please, tell 'em my name


Tell 'em how the crowds went wild


Tell 'em how I hope they shine


Long live the walls we crashed through


I had the time of my life with you[Chorus]


Long, long live the walls we crashed through


How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you


And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""


And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid

Elevator buttons and morning air


Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs


If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares


But right now, my time is theirs


Seems like there's always someone who disapproves


They'll judge it like they know about me and you


And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do


The jury's out, but my choice is you




[Chorus]


So don't you worry your pretty little mind


People throw rocks at things that shine


And life makes love look hard


The stakes are high, the water's rough


But this love is ours

Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me


Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles


But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine

Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and


I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you


'Cause I love the gap between your teeth


And I love the riddles that you speak


And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos


Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours

Sounded like footsteps on my stairs


Six months gone and I'm still reaching

Thinking 'bout everything we've been through


Maybe I've been going back too much lately


When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like


You would, you would if this was a movie


Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out

I know that we could work it out somehow


But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen


But I remember how it was back then


Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin'


'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them


Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street


Flashback to the night when you said to me


That nothing's gonna change, not for me and you


Back before I knew how much I had to lose[Chorus]

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter


You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30AM


As everything was slipping right out of our hands


I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street


Braced myself for the goodbye


'Cause that's all I've ever known


Then you took me by surprise


You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""[Chorus]


You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water


And every time I look at you, it's like the first time


I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter


She is the best thing that's ever been mine""

Sparks Fly,Speak Now,6d9IiDcFxtFVIvt9pCqyGH,260933,"[Verse 1]


The way you move is like a full on rainstorm and I'm a house of cards


You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'


But I kinda know that I won't get far


And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch


Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of




[Chorus]


Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain


Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain


'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down


Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around


'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile




[Verse 2]


My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea


You touch me once and it's really somethin'


You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be


I'm on my guard for the rest of the world


But with you, I know it's no good


And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would




[Chorus]


Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain


Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain


'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down


Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around


'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile[Bridge]


I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild


Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right


And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?


I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show




[Chorus]


Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain


Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain

Back To December,Speak Now,3DrjZArsPsoqbLzUZZV1Id,293026,"[Verse 1]


I'm so glad you made time to see me


How's life? Tell me, how's your family?


I haven't seen them in a while


You've been good, busier than ever


We small talk, work and the weather


Your guard is up and I know why




[Pre-Chorus]


Because the last time you saw me


Is still burned in the back of your mind


You gave me roses and I left them there to die




[Chorus]


So this is me swallowing my pride


Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""


And I go back to December all the time


It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you


Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine


I go back to December, turn around and make it alright


I go back to December all the time




[Verse 2]


These days, I haven't been sleeping


Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'


When your birthday passed and I didn't call


Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times


I watched you laughing from the passenger side


And realized I loved you in the fall[Pre-Chorus]


And then the cold came, the dark days


When fear crept into my mind


You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye




[Chorus]


So this is me swallowing my pride


Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""


And I go back to December all the time


It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you


Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine


I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind


I go back to December all the time




[Bridge]


I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile


So good to me, so right


And how you held me in your arms that September night


The first time you ever saw me cry


Maybe this is wishful thinkin'


Probably mindless dreaming


But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right


I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't


So, if the chain is on your door, I understand




[Chorus]


But this is me swallowing my pride


Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""


And I go back to December


It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you


Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I am not the kind of girl


Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion


But you are not the kind of boy

And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel


And she is yelling at a bridesmaid


Somewhere back inside a room


Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

I lose myself in a daydream

Don't wait or say a single vow


You need to hear me out

Fond gestures are exchanged


And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march


And I am hiding in the curtains


It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be[Pre-Chorus]


She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen


But I know you wish it was me


You wish it was me, don't you?

""Speak now or forever hold your peace""

Dear John,Speak Now,7hZuICN5eaCuQyp443RCt6,403920,"[Verse 1]


Long were the nights when


My days once revolved around you


Counting my footsteps


Praying the floor won't fall through again


And my mother accused me of losing my mind


But I swore I was fine


You paint me a blue sky


Then go back and turn it to rain


And I lived in your chess game


But you changed the rules everyday


Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight


Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why




[Chorus]


Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone


Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?


The girl in the dress cried the whole way home


I should've known




[Verse 2]


Well, maybe it's me


And my blind optimism to blame


Or maybe it's you and your sick need


To give love and take it away


And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors


Who don't understand


And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said


""Run as fast as you can""[Chorus]


Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone


Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?


The girl in the dress cried the whole way home


Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong


Don't you think nineteen's too young


To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?


I should've known




[Bridge]


You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry


Never impressed by me acing your tests


All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes


'Cause you burned them out


But I took your matches before fire could catch me


So don't look now


I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town


Oh, oh

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone


Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

And your wildfire lies and your humiliation


You have pointed out my flaws again

Now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did (Ha)


Haha, time for a little revenge




[Verse 1]


The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and


I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him


She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause


She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""


I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it


I underestimated just who I was dealing with


She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum


She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think


She's an actress, woah


She's better known for the things that she does


On the mattress, woah


Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys


On the playground won't make you many friends


She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind


There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha




[Verse 2]


She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list


She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it


I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling and


She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things


But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know


Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go


Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me


But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity


(Think about what you did)[Chorus]


She's not a saint and she's not what you think

Fresh on the pavement

I said, ""Remember this moment""


In the back of my mind


The time we stood with our shaking hands


The crowds in stands went wild


We were the kings and the queens


And they read off our names


The night you danced like you knew our lives


Would never be the same


You held your head like a hero


On a history book page


It was the end of a decade


But the start of an age

How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you


I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""

pretenders


One day, we will be remembered

I said, ""Remember this feeling""


I pass the pictures around


Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines


Wishing for right now


We are the kings and the queens


You traded your baseball cap for a crown


When they gave us our trophies


And we held them up for our town


And the cynics were outraged


Screaming, ""This is absurd""


'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves


In ripped up jeans got to rule the world[Chorus]


Long live the walls we crashed through


How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you


I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""


And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid

Confetti falls to the ground


May these memories break our fall


Will you take a moment? Promise me this


That you'll stand by me forever


But if, God forbid, fate should step in


And force us into a goodbye


If you have children some day


When they point to the pictures


Please, tell 'em my name


Tell 'em how the crowds went wild


Tell 'em how I hope they shine

I had the time of my life with you[Chorus]

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors


It's the mornin' of your very first day


You say ""hi"" to your friends you ain't seen in a while


Try and stay out of everybody's way


It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here


For the next four years in this town


Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say


""You know, I haven't seen you around before""




[Chorus]


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you


You're gonna believe them


And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out


Well, count to ten, take it in


This is life before you know who you're gonna be


Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail


And soon enough, you're best friends


Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool


We'll be outta here as soon as we can


And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car


And you're feelin' like flyin'


And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one


And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends


When the night ends[Chorus]


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you


You're gonna believe them


And when you're fifteen and your first kiss


Makes your head spin 'round


But in your life, you'll do things greater than


Dating the boy on the football team


But I didn't know it at fifteen




[Bridge]


When all you wanted was to be wanted


Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now


Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday


But I realized some bigger dreams of mine


And Abigail gave everything she had


To a boy who changed his mind


And we both cried




[Chorus]


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you


You're gonna believe them


And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall


I've found time can heal most anything


And you just might find who you're supposed to be


I didn't know who I was supposed to be

See you make your way through the crowd

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""


And I was crying on the staircase


Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

I keep waiting for you, but you never come


Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""


He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said

Once upon a time


I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye


And we caught onto something


I hold onto the night


You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me


Were you just kidding?


'Cause it seems to me


This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak


I don't feel welcome anymore


Baby, what happened? Please, tell me


'Cause one second, it was perfect


Now, you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called


And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all


And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""


Oh, and it 
rains in your bedroom


Everything is wrong


It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone


'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""




[Verse 2]


Was I out of line?


Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide


Like a scared little boy?


I looked into your eyes


Thought I knew you for a minute, now, I'm not so sure


So here's to everything coming down to nothing


Here's to silence that cuts me to the core


Where is this going?


Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore[Chorus]


And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called

Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides


Look now, the sky is gold


I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

But I know you're not scared of anything at all


Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away

I'm thirteen now


And don't know how my friends could be so mean


I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys


And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away


And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school


But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you


Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay

I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger


God smiles on my little brother, inside and out


He's better than I am


I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run


And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three


You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me


It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs


And Daddy's smart


And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now, I know why all the trees change in the fall


I know you were on my side even when I was wrong

Try and stay out of everybody's way

For the next four years in this town


Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say


""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

And you're feelin' like flyin'


And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one


And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends

When all you wanted was to be wanted


Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now


Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday


But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

To a boy who changed his mind


And we both cried

Teardrops On My Guitar - Radio Single Remix,Taylor Swift,7zMcNqs55Mxer82bvZFkpg,203040,"Becca:
 Celebration, a week of milestones. We are revisiting all of Taylor Swift's albums and celebrating their anniversaries. It's the twelfth year anniversary of Taylor Swift's debut album and we are playing all of the tracks off of her debut album, which came out October 24th, 2006. I know a lot of people could relate to this song. Taylor said, ""You know what? The guy at the time probably didn't know how I felt, but he did after this song came out.""




Taylor Swift:
 It's a song that I wrote about this guy who I had a big crush on, sat next to me in class, and he would come in to talk about his girlfriend every single day, and how pretty she was and how happy they were, and I never told him that I liked him, but I did write a song with his name in it, so, um, I guess the secret's out now. You know, that song is really about hiding how you really feel.




Becca:
 Yeah, I'd say the cat was definitely out of the bag after that one. And you know, the thing about Taylor Swift's song, ""Teardrops On My Guitar,"" it was so relatable to so many people, as are so many of Taylor Swift's songs.

Mary's Song (Oh My My My),Taylor Swift,2QrQCMel6v2JiLxqrg4p2O,213080,"[Verse 1]


She said I was seven and you were nine


I looked at you like the stars that shined


In the sky, the pretty lights


And our daddies used to joke about the two of us


Growing up and falling in love


And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes


And said, 
""Oh, my, my, my""




[Chorus]


Take me back to the house in the backyard tree


Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me


You never did, you never did


Take me back when our world was one block wide


I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried


Just two kids, you and I


Oh, my, my, my, my




[Verse 2]


Well, I was sixteen when suddenly


I wasn't that little girl you used to see


But your eyes still shined like pretty lights


And our daddies used to joke about the two of us


They never believed we'd really fall in love


And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes


And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""[Chorus]


Take me back to the creek beds we turned up


2 AM riding in your truck


And all I need is you next to me


Take me back to the time we had our very first fight


The slamming of doors 'stead of kissing goodnight


You stayed outside 'til the morning light


Oh, my, my, my, my




[Bridge]


A few years had gone and come around


We were sitting at our favorite spot in town


And you looked at me, 
got down on one knee




[Chorus]


Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle


Our whole town came and our mamas cried


You said, ""I do,"" and I did, too


Take me home where we met so many years before


We'll rock our babies on that very front porch


After all this time, you and I

The other on my heart

I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'


How we don't have a song""


And he says

Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window


When we're on the phone and you talk real slow


'Cause it's late and your mama don't know

And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""


Askin' God if he could play it again

In a field behind your yard

Just listen to the crickets sing


Everything I need is right here by my side

Let you know that what I feel is true


And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small-town boy and girl


Livin' in a crazy world


Tryna figure out what is and isn't true

My secrets or my deepest fears

Can he tell that I can't breathe?

I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

Fortnight (feat. Post Malone) - Cults Remix,Fortnight (Acoustic Version),7pM01Cfj8vt7z3qI2TveNT,194305,"[Verse 1: Taylor Swift & 
Post Malone
]


I was supposed to be sent away


But they forgot to come and get me


I was a functioning alcoholic


'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic (
Aesthetic, yeah
)


All of this to say I hope you're okay


But you're the reason


And no one here's to blame


But what about your quiet treason?




[Chorus: Taylor Swift]


And for a fortnight there, we were forever


Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather


Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors


Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her


(
I wanna kill her
)




[Verse 2: Taylor Swift & 
Post Malone
]


All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February


I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary


And I love you, it's ruining my life


I love you, it's ruining my life


I touched you for only a fortnight


I touched you
, but I touched you




[Chorus: Taylor Swift, 
Taylor Swift & Post Malone
]


And for a fortnight there, 
we were forever


Run into you sometimes, 
ask about the weather


Now you're in my backyard, turned 
into good neighbors


Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her


(
I wanna kill her
)


And for a fortnight there, 
we were together


Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater


Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors


My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him


(
I wanna kill him
)[Bridge: Taylor Swift, 
Post Malone
,

]


I love you, it's ruining my life


I love you, it's ruining my life


I touched you for only a fortnight


I touched you
, 
I touched you


I love you, it's ruining my life


I love you, it's ruining my life


I touched you for only a fortnight


I touched you

I touched you

Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up


'Nother fortnight lost in America


Move to Florida

But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]


Em đáng ra phải bị bắt đi rồi


Nhưng người ta đã quên đến đón em


Em là một con sâu rượu đang sống ổn thoả


Cho đến khi chẳng còn ai để ý đến gu thẩm mỹ mới của em nữa


Tất cả để nói rằng


Em mong anh vẫn ổn


Nhưng anh chính là lý do


Và chẳng ai trách gì đâu


Nhưng còn sự phản bội lặng thầm của anh thì sao?




[Điệp Khúc: Taylor Swift]


Và trong suốt 2 tuần ấy, mình bên nhau muôn đời


Đôi lần chạm mặt anh, hỏi vu vơ thời tiết


Giờ anh sau sân vườn, hóa thành hàng xóm tốt


Vợ anh đang tưới hoa, em muốn giết chết ả




[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, 
Taylor Swift & Post Malone
, 
Post Malone
]


Những sớm mai của em là những thứ Hai mắc kẹt trong một 
tháng 2 bất tận


Em đã uống thứ thuốc bước tiếp diệu kỳ, nhưng 
tác dụng chỉ là tạm thời thôi


Và em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em


Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em


Em chạm vào anh trong vỏn vẹn 2 tuần


Em chạm vào anh
, nhưng em đã bên anh[Điệp Khúc: Taylor Swift, 
Taylor Swift & Post Malone
]


Và trong suốt 2 tuần ấy, 
mình đã cùng bên nhau


Đôi lần chạm mặt anh, hỏi 
vu vơ thời tiết


Giờ anh sau sân vườn, hóa 
thành hàng xóm tốt


Vợ anh đang tưới hoa, em muốn giết chết ả


Và trong suốt 2 tuần ấy, 
mình đã cùng bên nhau


Đôi lần chạm mặt anh, khen chiếc áo em mang


Giờ anh ở hòm thư, hóa thành hàng xóm tốt


Chồng em đang ngoại tình, em muốn giết chết ảnh




[Bridge: Taylor Swift, 
Post Malone
, 
Taylor Swift & Post Malone
]


Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em


Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em


Em chạm tới anh trong vỏn vẹn 2 tuần


Em chạm vào anh, em chạm vào anh


Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em


Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em


Em chạm tới anh trong vỏn vẹn 2 tuần


Em chạm vào anh, em chạm vào anh




[Đoạn Kết: Post Malone, 
Post Malone & Taylor Swift
, 
Taylor Swift
]


Nghĩ đến chuyện gọi em, nhưng em chẳng bắt máy


Thêm 2 tuần nữa lạc giữa xứ cờ hoa


Chuyển đến Florida, 
mua chiếc xe em thích


Nhưng nó chẳng nổ máy tới khi em 
chạm, chạm, chạm vào anh


Nghĩ đến chuyện gọi em, nhưng em chẳng bắt máy


Thêm 2 tuần nữa lạc giữa xứ cờ hoa


Chuyển đến Florida, mua chiếc xe em thích


Nhưng nó chẳng nổ máy tới khi em chạm, chạm, chạm vào anh",Sad,0.52,0.393,11,-11.005,1,0.0314,0.517,5.69e-06,0.102,0.267,192.093,audio_features,6GrvlxquXWumwyNeZb1oZz,spotify:track:6GrvlxquXWumwyNeZb1oZz,https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/6GrvlxquXWumwyNeZb1oZz,https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/6GrvlxquXWumwyNeZb1oZz,228965,4

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]


Em đáng ra phải bị bắt đi rồi


Nhưng người ta đã quên đến đón em


Em là một con sâu rượu đang sống ổn thoả


Cho đến khi chẳng còn ai để ý đến gu thẩm mỹ mới của em nữa


Tất cả để nói rằng


Em mong anh vẫn ổn


Nhưng anh chính là lý do


Và chẳng ai trách gì đâu


Nhưng còn sự phản bội lặng thầm của anh thì sao?




[Điệp Khúc: Taylor Swift]


Và trong suốt 2 tuần ấy, mình bên nhau muôn đời


Đôi lần chạm mặt anh, hỏi vu vơ thời tiết


Giờ anh sau sân vườn, hóa thành hàng xóm tốt


Vợ anh đang tưới hoa, em muốn giết chết ả




[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, 
Taylor Swift & Post Malone
, 
Post Malone
]


Những sớm mai của em là những thứ Hai mắc kẹt trong một 
tháng 2 bất tận


Em đã uống thứ thuốc bước tiếp diệu kỳ, nhưng 
tác dụng chỉ là tạm thời thôi


Và em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em


Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em


Em chạm vào anh trong vỏn vẹn 2 tuần


Em chạm vào anh
, nhưng em đã bên anh[Điệp Khúc: Taylor Swift, 
Taylor Swift & Post Malone
]


Và trong suốt 2 tuần ấy, 
mình đã cùng bên nhau


Đôi lần chạm mặt anh, hỏi 
vu vơ thời tiết


Giờ anh sau sân vườn, hóa 
thành hàng xóm tốt


Vợ anh đang tưới hoa, em muốn giết chết ả


Và trong suốt 2 tuần ấy, 
mình đã cùng bên nhau


Đôi lần chạm mặt anh, khen chiếc áo em mang


Giờ anh ở hòm thư, hóa thành hàng xóm tốt


Chồng em đang ngoại tình, em muốn giết chết ảnh




[Bridge: Taylor Swift, 
Post Malone
, 
Taylor Swift & Post Malone
]


Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em


Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em


Em chạm tới anh trong vỏn vẹn 2 tuần


Em chạm vào anh, em chạm vào anh


Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em


Em yêu anh, thứ tình yêu đang phá hủy đời em


Em chạm tới anh trong vỏn vẹn 2 tuần


Em chạm vào anh, em chạm vào anh

Nghĩ đến chuyện gọi em, nhưng em chẳng bắt máy


Thêm 2 tuần nữa lạc giữa xứ cờ hoa


Chuyển đến Florida, 
mua chiếc xe em thích


Nhưng nó chẳng nổ máy tới khi em 
chạm, chạm, chạm vào anh


Nghĩ đến chuyện gọi em, nhưng em chẳng bắt máy

You say, ""I don't understand,"" and I say, ""I know you don't""


We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't


Remember lookin' at this room? We loved it 'cause of the light


Now, I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time




[Pre-Chorus]


Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?


I'm getting tired even for a phoenix


Always risin' from the ashes


Mendin' all her gashes


You might just have dealt the final blow




[Chorus]


Stop, you're losin' me


Stop, you're losin' me


Stop, you're losin' me


I can't find a pulse


My heart won't start anymore for you


'Cause you're losin' me




[Verse 2]


Every mornin', I glared at you with storms in my eyes


How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?


I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick


My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick[Pre-Chorus]


And the air is thick with loss and indecision


I know my pain is such an imposition


Now, you're runnin' down the hallway


And you know what they all say


""You don't know what you got until it's gone""




[Chorus]


Stop, you're losin' me


Stop, you're losin' me


Stop, you're losin' me


I can't find a pulse


My heart won't start anymore for you


'Cause you're losin' me


'Cause you're losin' me


Stop (Stop) 'cause you're losin' me




[Post-Chorus]


My heart won't start anymore


(Stop 'cause you're losin' me)


My heart won't start anymore


(Stop 'cause you're losin' me)




[Bridge]


How long could we be a sad song


'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?


I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy


And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier


Fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me


I'm the best thing at this party (You're losin' me)


And I wouldn't marry me either


A pathological people pleaser


Who only wanted you to see her


And I'm fadin', thinkin'


""Do something, babe, say something"" (Say something)


""Lose something, babe, risk something"" (You're losin' me)


""Choose something, babe, I got nothing"" (I got nothing)


""To believe, unless you're choosin' me""[Outro]

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night

Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price


You know that I bought it (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it

Killin' me slow, out the window


I'm always waitin' for you to be waitin' below

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night


You know that I caught it (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it
)


Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price


You know that I bought it (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it

We're not trying (
Oh yeah, you're right, I want it

I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone

(I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror)


(It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero)




[Verse 2]


Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby


And I'm a monster on the hill


Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city


Pierced through the heart, but never killed




[Pre-Chorus]


Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism


Like some kind of congressman?


(A tale as old as time)


I wake up screaming from dreaming


One day, I'll watch as you're leaving


And life will lose all its meaning


(For the last time)[Chorus]


It's me, hi


I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)


At teatime, everybody agrees


I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror


It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero




[Drop]


(It's me, hi)


(I'm the problem, it's, I'm the problem, it's—)


(At teatime)


(I'm the problem, it's, I'm the problem)


(It's me, hi)


(I'm the problem, it's, I'm the problem, it's—)


(At teatime)


(Everybody agrees)




[Outro]


It's me, hi (Hi)


I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)


At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)


I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror


It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero",Energetic,0.606,0.712,1,-4.946,0,0.0428,0.17,0.000152,0.34,0.383,97.01,audio_features,6C0H8ts9M6deezz0yYR6LK,spotify:track:6C0H8ts9M6deezz0yYR6LK,https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/6C0H8ts9M6deezz0yYR6LK,https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/6C0H8ts9M6deezz0yYR6LK,267960,4

The anti-hero


The anti-hero


The anti-hero


The anti-hero




[Verse 1]


I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser


Midnights become my afternoons


When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people


I've ghosted stand there in the room




[Pre-Chorus]


I should not be left to my own devices


They come with prices and vices


I end up in crisis


(Tale as old as time)


I wake up screaming from dreaming


One day, I'll watch as you're leaving


'Cause you got tired of my scheming


(For the last time)




[Chorus]


It's me, hi


I'm the problem, it's me


At teatime, everybody agrees


I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror


It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero[Post-Chorus]


(
It's me, hi, it's me, hi
) The anti-hero


(
It's me, hi, it's me, hi
) The anti-hero

(
It's me, hi, it's me, hi
) The anti-hero


(
It's me, hi, it's me, hi
) The anti-hero




[Verse 2]


Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby


And I'm a monster on the hill


Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city


Pierced through the heart, but never killed




[Pre-Chorus]


Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism


Like some kind of congressman?


(A tale as old as time)


I wake up screaming from dreaming


One day, I'll watch as you're leaving


And life will lose all its meaning


(For the last time)




[Chorus]


It's me, hi


I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)


At teatime, everybody agrees


I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror


It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero[Post-Chorus]

Anti-Hero,Anti-Hero (feat. Bleachers),70c3ObJaZ6tbc8CfDYAQjb,200690,"[Verse 1]


I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser


Midnights become my afternoons


When my depression works the graveyard shift
, 
all of the people


I've ghosted stand there in the room




[Pre-Chorus]


I should not be left to my own devices


They come with prices and vices


I end up in crisis


(Tale as old as time)


I wake up screaming from dreaming


One day, I'll watch as you're leaving


'Cause you got tired of my scheming


(For the last time)




[Chorus]


It's me, hi


I'm the problem, it's me


At teatime, everybody agrees


I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror


It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero




[Verse 2]


Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby


And I'm a monster on the hill


Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city


Pierced through the heart, but never killed[Pre-Chorus]


Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism


Like some kind of congressman?


(A tale as old as time)


I wake up screaming from dreaming


One day, I'll watch as you're leaving


And life will lose all its meaning


(For the last time)




[Chorus]


It's me, hi


I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)


At teatime, everybody agrees


I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror


It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero




[Bridge]


I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money


She thinks I left them in the will


The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out


""She's laughing up at us from Hell""




[Breakdown]


It's me, hi


I'm the problem, it's me


It's me, hi


I'm the problem, it's me


It's me, hi


Everybody agrees, everybody agrees[Chorus]


It's me, hi (Hi)


I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)


At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)


I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (The Short Film),All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (The Short Film),1u4HUiREUR6vX1W1RYG2Tm,686022,"[Verse 1]


I walked through the door with you, the air was cold


But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow


And I left my scarf there at your sister's house


And you've still got it in your drawer, even now




[Verse 2]


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze


We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate


Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place


And I can picture it after all these days




[Pre-Chorus]


And I know it's long gone and


That magic's not here no more


And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all


Oh, oh, oh




[Chorus]


'Causе there we arе again on that little town street


You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me


Wind in my hair, I was there


I remember it all too well




[Verse 3]


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red


You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed


And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team


You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me


And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""


Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town


And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now


He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was


'Til we were dead and gone and buried


Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same


After three months in the grave


And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you


But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame[Pre-Chorus]


And I know it's long gone and


There was nothing else I could do


And I forget about you long enough


To forget why I needed to




[Chorus]


'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night


We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light


Down the stairs, I was there


I remember it all too well


And there we are again when nobody had to know


You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath


Sacred prayer and we'd swear


To remember it all too well, yeah




[Bridge]


Well
, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much


But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up


Runnin' scared, I was there


I remember it all too well


And you call me up again just to break me like a promise


So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest


I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here


'Cause I remember it all, all, all[Verse 4]


They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell


Every time you double-cross my mind


You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine


And that made me want to die


The idea you had of me, who was she?


A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you


Not weepin' in a party bathroom


Some actress askin' me what happened, you


That's what happened, you


You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes


Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show


But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come


And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""




[Verse 5]


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it


I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it


After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own


Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone


But you keep my old scarf from that very first week


'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me


You can't get rid of it


'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah




[Chorus]


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so


Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known


It was rare, I was there


I remember it all too well


Wind in my hair, you were there


You remember it all


Down the stairs, you were there


You remember it all


It was rare, I was there


I remember it all too well[Verse 6]


And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes


""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""


From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones


I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight


And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?


Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?


'Cause in this city's barren cold


I still remember the first fall of snow


And how it glistened as it fell


I remember it all too well




[Outro]


Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?


Just between us, do you remember it all too well?


Just between us, I remember it all too well (Just between us)


They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell


Every time you double-cross my mind


You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine


And that made me want to die


The idea you had of me, who was she?


A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you


Not weepin' in a party bathroom


Some actress askin' me what happened, you


That's what happened, you


You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes


Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show


But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come


And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""


Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there


Down the stairs, I was there, I was there


Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there",Sad,0.625,0.515,0,-10.202,1,0.0281,0.323,3.53e-05,0.0764,0.193,93.021,audio_features,1u4HUiREUR6vX1W1RYG2Tm,spotify:track:1u4HUiREUR6vX1W1RYG2Tm,https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/1u4HUiREUR6vX1W1RYG2Tm,https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/1u4HUiREUR6vX1W1RYG2Tm,686022,4

Clear blue water


High tide came and brought you in


And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will


Skies grew darker


Currents swept you out again


And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone




[Pre-Chorus]


In silent screams, in wildest dreams


I never dreamed of this




[Chorus]


This love is good, this love is bad


This love is alive back from the dead (Oh-oh-oh)


These hands had to let it go free and


This love came back to me (Oh-oh-oh)

Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]


Tossing, turning


Struggled through the night with someone new


Baby, I could go on and on, on and on


Lantern, burning


Flickered in my mind for only you


But you were still gone, gone, gone[Pre-Chorus]


In losin' grip, on sinking ships


You showed up just in time




[Chorus]


This love is good, this love is bad


This love is alive back from the dead (Oh-oh-oh)


These hands had to let it go free and


This love came back to me (Oh-oh-oh)


This love left a permanent mark


This love is glowing in the dark (Oh-oh-oh)


These hands had to let it go free and


This love came back to me, oh-oh-oh

Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave


Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees


When you're young, you just run


But you come back to what you need[Chorus]


This love is good, this love is bad


This love is alive back from the dead (Oh-oh-oh)

Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""


I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""


Nothing lasts forever


But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell


He's so bad, but he does it so well


I can see the end as it begins


My one condition is

Starin' at the sunset, babe


Red lips and rosy cheeks


Say you'll see me again

He's so bad, but he does it so well

And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'

My winter nights are taken up by static


Stress and holiday shopping traffic


But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else


Just like magic




[Verse 1]


In my heart is a Christmas tree farm


Where the people would come


To dance under sparkling lights


Bundled up in their mittens and coats


And the cider would flow


And I just wanna be there tonight




[Pre-Chorus]


Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon


Mistakes are forgiven


And everythin' is icy and blue


And you would be there too




[Chorus]


Under the mistlеtoe


Watchin' the fire glow


And tеllin' me, ""I love you""


Just bein' in your arms


Takes me back to that little farm


Where every wish comes true[Verse 2]


In my heart is a Christmas tree farm


There's a light in the barn


We'd run inside out from the cold


In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs


And they're warm and they're safe


They wake to see a blanket of snow




[Pre-Chorus]


Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon


Mistakes are forgiven


And everythin' is icy and blue


And you would be there too




[Chorus]


Under the mistletoe


Watchin' the fire glow


And tellin' me, ""I love you""


Just bein' in your arms


Takes me back to that little farm


Where every wish comes true


Baby, yeah




[Bridge]


And when I'm feelin' alone


You remind me of home


Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas


And when the world isn't fair


I pretend that we're there


Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)[Chorus]


Under the mistletoe (To you)


Watching the fire glow


And tellin' me, ""I love you""

All Too Well (Sad Girl Autumn Version) - Recorded at Long Pond Studios,All Too Well (Sad Girl Autumn Version) - Recorded at Long Pond Studios,1n3b9Eekoy3S9ZSZ5DmTW1,598150,"[Verse 1]


I walked through the door with you, the air was cold


But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow


And I left my scarf there at your sister's house


And you've still got it in your drawer, even now




[Verse 2]


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze


We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate


Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place


And I can picture it after all these days




[Pre-Chorus]


And I know it's long gone and


That magic's not here no more


And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all


Oh, oh, oh




[Chorus]


'Cause there we are again on that little town street


You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me


Wind in my hair, I was there


I remember it all too well




[Verse 3]


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red


You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed


And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team


You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me


And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""


Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town


And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now


He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was


'Til we were dead and gone and buried


Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same


After three months in the grave


And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you


But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame[Pre-Chorus]


And I know it's long gone and


There was nothing else I could do


And I forget about you long enough


To forget why I needed to




[Chorus]


'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night


We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light


Down the stairs, I was there


I remember it all too well


And there we are again when nobody had to know


You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath


Sacred prayer and we'd swear


To remember it all too well, oh-oh-oh-oh




[Bridge]


And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much


Maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up


Runnin' scared, I was there


I remember it all too well


And you call me up again just to break me like a promise


So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest


I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here


'Cause I remember it all, all, all[Verse 4]


They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell


Every time you double-cross my mind


You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine


And that made me want to die


The idea you had of me, who was she?


A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you


Not weepin' in a party bathroom


Some actress askin' me what happened, you


That's what happened, you


You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes


Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show


But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come


And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""




[Verse 5]


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it


I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it


After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own


Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone


But you keep my old scarf from that very first week


'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me


You can't get rid of it


'Cause you remember it all too well




[Chorus]


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so


Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known


It was rare, I was there


I remember it all too well


Wind in my hair, you were there


You remember it all


Down the stairs, you were there


You remember it all


It was rare, I was there


I remember it all too well[Verse 6]


And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes


""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""


From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones


I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight


And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?


Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?


'Cause in this city's barren cold


I still remember the first fall of snow


And how it glistened as it fell


I remember it all too well




[Outro]


Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?


Just between us, do you remember it all too well?


Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well


Just between us, I remember it


Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)


Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)


Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there


It was rare, you remember it all too well


Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there


Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)


Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there


It was rare, you remember it (All too well)

It feels like a perfect night


For breakfast at midnight


To fall in love with strangers


Uh-uh, uh-uh




[Pre-Chorus]


Yeah


We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time


It's miserable and magical, oh yeah


Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines


It's time, oh-oh

I don't know about you


But I'm feelin' twenty-two


Everything will be alright if


You keep me next to you


You don't know about me


But I'll bet you want to


Everything will bе alright if


We just keep dancin' like we'rе


Twenty-two


Twenty-two[Verse 2]


It seems like one of those nights


This place is too crowded


Too many cool kids


Uh-uh, uh-uh (Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew)


It seems like one of those nights


We ditch the whole scene


And end up dreamin'


Instead of sleepin'




[Pre-Chorus]


Yeah


We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way


It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah


Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks


It's time, oh-oh

But I'm feelin' twenty-two


Everything will be alright if (Ooh)

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (Taylor's Version),The More Red (Taylor’s Version) Chapter,4VTnbHXKIkfqqzfZwpJzA1,193146,"[Verse 1]


I remember when we broke up the first time


Sayin', ""This is it, I've had enough""


'Cause, like, we hadn't seen each other in a month


When you said you needed space, what?


Then you come around again and say


""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""


Remember how that lasted for a day?


I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""




[Pre-Chorus]


Ooh, we called it off again last night, but


Ooh, this time, I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you




[Chorus]


We are never, evеr, ever gettin' back togеther


We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together


You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me


But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together




[Post-Chorus]


Like, ever




[Verse 2]


I'm really gonna miss you pickin' fights


And me fallin' for it, screaming that I'm right


And you would hide away and find your peace of mind


With some indie record that's much cooler than mine (Haha)[Pre-Chorus]


Ooh, you called me up again tonight, but


Ooh, this time, I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you (Oh)




[Chorus]


We (We) are never, ever, ever gettin' back together


We are never, ever, ever (Ever) gettin' back together


You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)


But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together




[Post-Chorus]


Ooh (Yeah), ooh (Yeah)


Ooh (Yeah), oh




[Bridge]


I used to think that we were forever, ever


And I used to say, ""Never say never""


Ugh, so he calls me up and he's, like, ""I still love you""


And I'm, like, I'm just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?


Like, we are never getting back together


Like, ever (No)




[Chorus]


We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together


We are never, ever, ever (Oh) gettin' back together


You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (To me)

All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),The More Red (Taylor’s Version) Chapter,7Eb9KO7l6Qt8skHG9oRQBD,613000,"[Verse 1]


I walked through the door with you, the air was cold


But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow


And I left my scarf there at your sister's house


And you've still got it in your drawer, even now




[Verse 2]


Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze


We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate


Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place


And I can picture it after all these days




[Pre-Chorus]


And I know it's long gone and


That magic's not here no more


And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all


Oh, oh, oh




[Chorus]


'Causе there we arе again on that little town street


You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me


Wind in my hair, I was there


I remember it all too well




[Verse 3]


Photo album on the counter, 
your cheeks were turnin' red


You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed


And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the 
tee-ball team


You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me


And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""


Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town


And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now


He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was


'Til we were dead and gone and buried


Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same


After three months in the grave


And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you


But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame[Pre-Chorus]


And I know it's long gone and


There was nothing else I could do


And I forget about you long enough


To forget why I needed to




[Chorus]


'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night


We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light


Down the stairs, I was there


I remember it all too well


And there we are again when nobody had to know


You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath


Sacred prayer and we'd swear


To remember it all too well, yeah




[Bridge]


Well, maybe we got 
lost in translation
, maybe I asked for too much


But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up


Runnin' scared, I was there


I remember it all too well


And you call me up again just to break me like a promise


So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest


I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here


'Cause I remember it all, all, all[Verse 4]


They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell


Every time you double-cross my mind


You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine


And that made me want to die


The idea you had of me, who was she?


A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you


Not weepin' in a party bathroom


Some actress askin' me what happened, you


That's what happened, you


You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes


Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show


But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come


And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""




[Verse 5]


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it


I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it


After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own


Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone


But you keep my old scarf from that very first week


'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me


You can't get rid of it


'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah




[Chorus]


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so


Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known


It was rare, I was there


I remember it all too well


Wind in my hair, you were there


You remember it all


Down the stairs, you were there


You remember it all


It was rare, I was there


I remember it all too well[Verse 6]


And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes


""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""


From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones


I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight


And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?


Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?


'Cause in this city's barren cold


I still remember the first fall of snow


And how it glistened as it fell


I remember it all too well




[Outro]


Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?


Just between us, do you remember it all too well?


Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well


Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)


Down the stairs, I was there, I was there


Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there


It was rare, you remember it all too well


Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)


Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)


Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there


It was rare, you remember it (All too well)


Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there


Down the stairs, I was there, I was there


Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there


It was rare, you remember it


Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there


Down the stairs, I was there, I was there

Everybody's waitin'


Everybody's watchin'


Even when you're sleepin'


Keep your eyes open




[Verse 1]


The tricky thing


Is yesterday, we were just children


Playing soldiers, just pretending


Dreaming dreams with happy endings


In backyards


Winning battles with our wooden swords


But now we've stepped into a cruel world


Where everybody stands and keeps score

Everybody's waitin' for you to break down


Everybody's watchin' to see the fallout


Even when you're sleepin', sleepin'


Keep your eyes open

Keep your eyes open


Keep your eyes open[Verse 2]


So here you are


Two steps ahead and stayin' on guard


Every lesson forms a new scar


They never thought you'd make it this far


But turn around (Turn around)


Oh, they've surrounded you, it's a showdown (Showdown)


And nobody comes to save you now


But you got somethin' they don't


Yeah, you got somethin' they don't

You just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybody's waitin' for you to break down


Everybody's watchin' to see the fallout


Even when you're sleepin', sleepin'


Keep your eyes open

Keep your eyes open


Keep your eyes

Keep your feet ready, heartbeat steady


Keep your eyes open


Keep your aim locked, the night goes dark
